  "title": "FARE: Provably Fair Representation Learning",
  "abstract": "Fair representation learning (FRL) is a popular class of methods aiming to produce\nfair classiﬁers via data preprocessing. However, recent work has shown that prior\nmethods achieve worse accuracy-fairness tradeoffs than originally suggested by\ntheir results. This dictates the need for FRL methods that provide provable upper\nbounds on unfairness of any downstream classiﬁer, a challenge yet unsolved. In\nthis work we address this challenge and propose Fairness with Restricted Encoders\n(FARE), the ﬁrst FRL method with provable fairness guarantees. Our key in-\nsight is that restricting the representation space of the encoder enables us to derive\nsuitable fairness guarantees, while allowing empirical accuracy-fairness tradeoffs\ncomparable to prior work. FARE instantiates this idea with a tree-based encoder,\na choice motivated by inherent advantages of decision trees when applied in our\nsetting. Crucially, we develop and apply a practical statistical procedure that com-\nputes a high-conﬁdence upper bound on the unfairness of any downstream clas-\nsiﬁer. In our experimental evaluation on several datasets and settings we demon-\nstrate that FARE produces tight upper bounds, often comparable with empirical\nresults of prior methods, which establishes the practical value of our approach.\n1 I NTRODUCTION",
  "summary": "### Overview of the Paper: FARE - Fairness with Restricted Encoders\n\nThe paper introduces **FARE (Fairness with Restricted Encoders)**, a novel method for **Fair Representation Learning (FRL)** that provides **provable upper bounds on unfairness** for any downstream classifier trained on its representations. Unlike prior FRL methods, which often fail to guarantee fairness for all downstream classifiers or rely on impractical assumptions (e.g., knowledge of input distributions), FARE ensures fairness through a restricted representation space and statistical guarantees.\n\n---\n\n### Key Contributions and Methodology\n\n1. **Provable Fairness Guarantees**:\n   - FARE ensures that the unfairness of any downstream classifier remains below a provable upper bound, addressing a critical gap in FRL research.\n   - The method uses **demographic parity (DP) distance** as the fairness metric, ensuring equal likelihood of positive outcomes across sensitive groups. It can also adapt to other fairness definitions, such as equalized odds.\n\n2. **Restricted Representation Space**:\n   - FARE limits the encoder's representation space to a finite set of discrete cells, enabling the derivation of fairness guarantees.\n   - This restriction allows the computation of high-confidence upper bounds on unfairness without requiring knowledge of the input distribution.\n\n3. **Tree-Based Encoder**:\n   - FARE employs decision trees as encoders, which partition the input space into discrete cells. All data points within a cell are mapped to the same representation.\n   - The decision tree encoder is modified to include a fairness-aware criterion, balancing accuracy and fairness through a hyperparameter.\n\n4. **Statistical Procedure for Fairness Bounds**:\n   - FARE computes high-confidence upper bounds on unfairness by estimating conditional probabilities for sensitive groups within each cell and applying statistical tools like Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals and Hoeffding's inequality.\n   - The fairness bound is derived as:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta DP_{Z_0, Z_1}(g) \\leq 2S - 1,\n     \\]\n     where \\( S \\) is the upper bound on the balanced accuracy of an optimal adversary predicting group membership.\n\n---\n\n### Results and Empirical Validation\n\n1. **Tight Upper Bounds**:\n   - FARE produces tight fairness bounds, ensuring that no downstream classifier trained on its representations can exceed the provable upper bound on unfairness.\n   - For example, in one experiment, FARE confirmed that all 64 possible classifiers (for \\( k=6 \\) representations) had DP distances below the upper bound, while baseline methods exhibited higher DP distances.\n\n2. **Accuracy-Fairness Tradeoff**:\n   - FARE achieves accuracy-fairness tradeoffs comparable to or better than prior FRL methods. For instance, on the ACSIncome-CA dataset, FARE's provable bounds on DP distance were close to the empirical values of other methods, while providing stronger fairness guarantees.\n\n3. **Scalability**:\n   - FARE benefits from larger datasets, as increasing the sample size tightens the fairness bounds. Experiments on the ACSIncome-US dataset showed that doubling the dataset size significantly reduced the upper bound on DP distance.\n\n4. **Robustness to Sensitive Attribute Imbalance**:\n   - FARE adapts well to varying levels of imbalance in sensitive attributes, maintaining strong fairness-accuracy tradeoffs even in highly imbalanced scenarios.\n\n5. **Transfer Learning**:\n   - FARE was evaluated on the Health dataset for transfer learning across five tasks. It consistently reduced DP distance below thresholds (e.g., 0.20 or 0.05), though it sometimes sacrificed more accuracy compared to other methods due to its restricted encoder design.\n\n6. **Efficiency and Interpretability**:\n   - FARE is computationally efficient, with runtimes of seconds compared to minutes or hours for baselines.\n   - Its decision tree-based representations are inherently interpretable, adding another advantage over existing methods.\n\n---\n\n### Comparison to Prior Work\n\n1. **Improvements Over Existing FRL Methods**:\n   - FARE addresses limitations of prior methods like **FNF (Balunović et al., 2022)**, which required impractical assumptions about input distributions.\n   - Unlike adversarial or optimization-based approaches, FARE guarantees fairness for all possible downstream classifiers, providing high-confidence fairness bounds for finite datasets.\n\n2. **Limitations of Prior Work**:\n   - Many prior methods rely on approximations (e.g., adversary accuracy, mutual information) or assumptions (e.g., known input distributions), which limit their ability to provide provable fairness guarantees.\n   - For example, adversarial methods (Madras et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2020) lack finite-sample certificates, and normalizing flow-based architectures (Balunović et al., 2022) depend on estimated input distributions.\n\n---\n\n### Technical Details\n\n1. **Fairness Metric**:\n   - The demographic parity distance is used to measure fairness, ensuring equal treatment across sensitive groups. The method can be adapted to other fairness definitions.\n\n2. **Upper-Bounding Procedure**:\n   - The balanced accuracy of an optimal adversary predicting group membership is reformulated as a sum over discrete cells:\n     \\[\n     BA_{Z_0, Z_1}(h^*) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\max(p_0(z_i), p_1(z_i)).\n     \\]\n   - Confidence intervals and statistical bounds are used to compute an upper bound on \\( BA_{Z_0, Z_1}(h^*) \\), leading to the final fairness bound.\n\n3. **Practical Implementation**:\n   - The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. The encoder is trained on the training set, and the fairness bound is computed on the validation and test sets.\n\n4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n   - FARE's parameters (e.g., fairness-accuracy tradeoff, number of cells) are tuned to balance fairness, accuracy, and bound tightness.\n\n---\n\n### Practical Impact and Future Directions\n\n1. **Real-World Applicability**:\n   - FARE is particularly suited for applications where fairness is critical or legally mandated, such as hiring, lending, and healthcare.\n   - Its provable fairness guarantees provide practitioners with reliable assurances, making it a practical choice for real-world machine learning tasks.\n\n2. **Future Work**:\n   - Exploring alternative encoders to improve the fairness-accuracy tradeoff, especially in transfer learning settings.\n   - Extending the method to other fairness definitions and more complex data distributions.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFARE represents a significant advancement in Fair Representation Learning by combining theoretical rigor with practical applicability. It provides **provable fairness guarantees**, **tight fairness bounds**, and **competitive accuracy-fairness tradeoffs**, outperforming or matching existing methods in key metrics. Its robustness, scalability, and interpretability make it a valuable tool for mitigating bias in machine learning.",

  "rev": "**1. Summary**  \nThe paper presents FARE (Fairness with Restricted Encoders), a novel approach to Fair Representation Learning (FRL) that provides provable upper bounds on unfairness for any downstream classifier trained on its representations. FARE achieves this by restricting the encoder's representation space to a finite set of discrete cells, allowing for statistical guarantees of fairness without requiring knowledge of input distributions. The method employs decision trees as encoders and uses demographic parity distance as the fairness metric. Empirical results demonstrate FARE's ability to produce tight fairness bounds, achieve competitive accuracy-fairness tradeoffs, and maintain robustness across various datasets and scenarios.\n\n**2. Strengths**  \n- **Provable Fairness Guarantees**: FARE provides theoretical assurances of fairness, addressing a significant gap in existing FRL methods.\n- **Innovative Methodology**: The use of restricted representation spaces and decision tree encoders is a novel approach that enhances interpretability and computational efficiency.\n- **Empirical Validation**: The paper includes comprehensive experiments demonstrating FARE's effectiveness in achieving tight fairness bounds and competitive tradeoffs.\n- **Scalability and Robustness**: FARE's performance improves with larger datasets, and it adapts well to imbalances in sensitive attributes.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**  \n- **Clarity of Assumptions**: The paper lacks explicit clarification of assumptions underlying the theoretical guarantees (e.g., Section 3.2). It would benefit from a dedicated subsection detailing these assumptions.\n- **Comparison with Existing Methods**: While the paper compares FARE with some baseline methods, it lacks a comprehensive discussion of related work and how FARE's contributions distinctly advance the field (e.g., Section 2). Including a more thorough literature review would strengthen the contextualization of FARE's contributions.\n- **Justification of Methodology**: The choice of decision tree encoders and specific fairness metrics is not fully justified (e.g., Section 4.1). Providing a rationale for these choices, possibly with references to related work, would enhance the paper's credibility.\n- **Experimental Design**: The experiments could be improved by including additional metrics to evaluate different aspects of FARE's performance, such as computational complexity or sensitivity to hyperparameters (e.g., Section 5).\n- **Presentation of Results**: Some figures and tables, such as Figure 4, lack clarity in their captions and could benefit from more detailed explanations to ensure they are self-sufficient and comprehensible.\n\n**4. Clarity & Reproducibility**  \n  **(a) Textual Clarity**  \n  The paper is generally well-organized, with clear section titles and logical progression of ideas. However, some sections, particularly those detailing theoretical foundations, could benefit from more explicit explanations of assumptions and limitations. Mathematical notations are mostly well-defined, but additional clarity in the presentation of key equations would be beneficial.\n\n  **(b) Figure & Caption Clarity**  \n  Figures effectively illustrate the main claims, but some captions lack sufficient detail to be fully self-explanatory. Ensuring that all figures include comprehensive captions and that axes, labels, and legends are consistently readable would improve the paper's clarity.\n\n  **(c) Reproducibility Transparency**  \n  The paper provides a reasonable level of detail regarding experimental setups, including datasets and hyperparameters. However, it does not mention code or data availability, which is crucial for reproducibility. Including this information, along with any ablation studies on key parameters, would enhance transparency.\n\n**5. Novelty & Significance**  \nFARE introduces a novel approach to Fair Representation Learning by providing provable fairness guarantees through a restricted representation space. This contribution is significant as it addresses a critical limitation of existing FRL methods, which often lack such guarantees. The paper's methodology is well-motivated and contextualized within the literature, although a more comprehensive discussion of related work would strengthen its impact. The empirical results substantiate the claims, demonstrating FARE's potential to advance the field of fair machine learning. Overall, FARE's contributions are valuable, offering new insights and practical solutions for ensuring fairness in machine learning applications.",
