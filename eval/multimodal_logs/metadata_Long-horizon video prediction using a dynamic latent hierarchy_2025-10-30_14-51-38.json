  "title": "Long-horizon video prediction using a dynamic latent hierarchy",
  "abstract": "The task of video prediction and generation is known to be notoriously difficult,\nwith the research in this area largely limited to short-term predictions. Though\nplagued with noise and stochasticity, videos consist of features that are organised\nin a spatiotemporal hierarchy, different features possessing different temporal dy-\nnamics. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Latent Hierarchy (DLH) – a deep\nhierarchical latent model that represents videos as a hierarchy of latent states that\nevolve over separate and fluid timescales. Each latent state is a mixture distri-\nbution with two components, representing the immediate past and the predicted\nfuture, causing the model to learn transitions only between sufficiently dissimi-\nlar states, while clustering temporally persistent states closer together. Using this\nunique property, DLH naturally discovers the spatiotemporal structure of a dataset\nand learns disentangled representations across its hierarchy. We hypothesise that\nthis simplifies the task of modeling temporal dynamics of a video, improves the\nlearning of long-term dependencies, and reduces error accumulation. As evidence,\nwe demonstrate that DLH outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in video pre-\ndiction, is able to better represent stochasticity, as well as to dynamically adjust its\nhierarchical and temporal structure. Our paper shows, among other things, how\nprogress in representation learning can translate into progress in prediction tasks.\n1 I NTRODUCTION",
  "summary": "### Overview of the Paper: Dynamic Latent Hierarchies (DLH) for Long-Horizon Video Prediction\n\nThe paper introduces **Dynamic Latent Hierarchies (DLH)**, a novel hierarchical latent-variable generative model designed to address the challenges of long-horizon video prediction. Video prediction is inherently difficult due to noise, stochasticity, and complex temporal dynamics, particularly over extended sequences where error accumulation becomes significant. DLH tackles these issues by representing videos as a hierarchy of latent states evolving over flexible timescales, enabling effective modeling of spatiotemporal structures.\n\n---\n\n### Key Features of DLH\n\n1. **Hierarchical Latent States**:\n   - DLH organizes video features into a hierarchy, where each latent state is modeled as a **temporal mixture of Gaussians (MoG)** with two components:\n     - A **static prior** representing no change.\n     - A **change prior** representing progression over time.\n   - An indicator variable determines whether a state is updated or remains fixed, allowing the model to transition between states only when significant changes occur. This reduces error accumulation and computational complexity.\n\n2. **Dynamic Temporal Hierarchy**:\n   - The model learns the temporal hierarchy of video features in an unsupervised manner, clustering temporally persistent states (e.g., static backgrounds) closer together while separating dynamic states (e.g., moving objects).\n   - Higher levels in the hierarchy represent slower-changing features, while lower levels capture faster dynamics, ensuring spatiotemporal disentanglement.\n\n3. **Improved Representation**:\n   - DLH disentangles hierarchical and temporal features, simplifying the modeling of complex video dynamics and improving long-term prediction quality.\n\n---\n\n### Model Architecture and Training\n\n1. **Core Components**:\n   - **Encoder** and **Decoder**: Process input data and reconstruct frames using convolutional layers.\n   - **Temporal Module**: Models temporal dynamics using GRUs.\n   - **Latent States**: Hierarchical latent variables are represented as deterministic and random variables, with the latter modeled as diagonal Gaussians.\n   - **Posterior and Prior States**: Approximated using neural networks, with the posterior estimated via a mean-field factorization.\n\n2. **Training Objective**:\n   - The model is trained using a **variational lower bound (ELBO)**, which includes:\n     - **Data likelihood**: Improves frame reconstruction quality.\n     - **KL divergence for latent states**: Regularizes the latent space by clustering states closer to static or change priors.\n     - **KL divergence for indicator variables**: Learns the evolution of static and dynamic states over time.\n\n3. **Inference**:\n   - The posterior distribution is estimated using a **non-parametric method** that avoids biases introduced by overly confident prior models, outperforming traditional approaches like the VaDE trick.\n\n4. **Computational Efficiency**:\n   - DLH enforces constraints on the hierarchical structure, such as pruning unused levels and updating only the necessary latent states. This reduces computational overhead while maintaining prediction quality.\n\n---\n\n### Experimental Results\n\n1. **Datasets**:\n   - DLH was evaluated on diverse datasets, including Moving MNIST, KTH Action, DeepMind Lab Mazes, and a toy Moving Ball dataset, with sequences ranging from 200 to 300 timesteps.\n\n2. **Benchmarks**:\n   - DLH was compared against state-of-the-art models, including CW-VAE, VTA, and LMC-Memory.\n\n3. **Quantitative Results**:\n   - DLH consistently outperformed benchmarks in metrics like Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):\n     - **Moving MNIST**: DLH achieved SSIM = 0.84 and PSNR = 24.7, outperforming CW-VAE (SSIM = 0.80, PSNR = 22.0) and others.\n     - **DML Mazes**: DLH achieved SSIM = 0.59 and PSNR = 14.3, surpassing CW-VAE and VTA in SSIM.\n\n4. **Qualitative Results**:\n   - DLH generated coherent and sharp predictions, preserving contextual and structural consistency in long-horizon predictions. For example:\n     - In Moving MNIST, DLH maintained digit positions and styles.\n     - In DML Mazes, it accurately predicted maze transitions and configurations.\n\n5. **Hierarchical Abstraction**:\n   - DLH naturally minimized resource usage by collapsing unused hierarchical levels, focusing on the most informative levels. For instance:\n     - Higher levels captured slower-changing features like static backgrounds.\n     - Lower levels encoded faster dynamics like object motion.\n\n6. **Handling Temporal Stochasticity**:\n   - DLH effectively modeled stochasticity using its temporal MoG mechanism, generating realistic rollouts even in datasets with high temporal variability.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insights and Contributions\n\n1. **Novel Hierarchical Generative Model**:\n   - DLH introduces a dynamic latent hierarchy with temporal MoG components, enabling flexible modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics.\n\n2. **Emergent Properties**:\n   - The hierarchical structure promotes disentanglement and computational efficiency, with emergent clustering of similar temporal states.\n\n3. **Superior Performance**:\n   - DLH outperformed state-of-the-art benchmarks in long-horizon video prediction, demonstrating improved representation of stochasticity and long-term dependencies.\n\n4. **Efficient Resource Utilization**:\n   - The model dynamically adjusted its structural complexity, leveraging hierarchical levels only as needed.\n\n---\n\n### Limitations and Future Work\n\n1. **Sharpness in Predictions**:\n   - Like other VAE-based models, DLH struggled with generating sharp predictions, particularly in high-resolution datasets. Future work could explore integrating diffusion models or adversarial training to address this limitation.\n\n2. **Relaxing Constraints**:\n   - The hierarchical constraints could be further relaxed to improve flexibility and approximation quality.\n\n3. **Scalability**:\n   - While DLH demonstrated efficiency, scaling to higher-resolution video datasets remains a challenge.\n\n---\n\n### Related Work and Context\n\n1. **Video Prediction**:\n   - DLH builds on prior work in deterministic models, VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, addressing their limitations in handling stochasticity and long-term dependencies.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Generative Models**:\n   - DLH extends hierarchical VAEs by incorporating temporal abstraction and dynamic latent hierarchies.\n\n3. **Temporal Abstraction**:\n   - The model leverages insights from temporal abstraction literature, clustering features at different timescales for improved sequential data modeling.\n\n4. **Gaussian Mixtures in VAEs**:\n   - DLH adapts Gaussian Mixture VAEs for temporal modeling, introducing a novel non-parametric inference method.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe paper presents **Dynamic Latent Hierarchies (DLH)** as a state-of-the-art solution for long-horizon video prediction. By leveraging hierarchical latent variables, temporal abstraction, and efficient inference techniques, DLH achieves spatiotemporal disentanglement, superior prediction quality, and computational efficiency. Its ability to dynamically adjust its structure and handle stochasticity makes it a promising approach for complex video prediction tasks. Future work could further enhance its scalability and sharpness, paving the way for broader applications in video generation and modeling.",
