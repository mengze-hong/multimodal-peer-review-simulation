  "title": "On the Sensitivity of Reward Inference to Model Misspecification in Human Models",
  "abstract": "Inferring reward functions from human behavior is at the center of value alignment\n– aligning AI objectives with what we, humans, actually want. But doing so\nrelies on models of how humans behave given their objectives. After decades of\nresearch in cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral economics, obtaining\naccurate human models remains an open research topic. This begs the question:\nhow accurate do these models need to be in order for the reward inference to be\naccurate? On the one hand, if small errors in the model can lead to catastrophic\nerror in inference, the entire framework of reward learning seems ill-fated, as we\nwill never have perfect models of human behavior. On the other hand, if as our\nmodels improve, we can have a guarantee that reward accuracy also improves, this\nwould show the beneﬁt of more work on the modeling side. We study this question\nboth theoretically and empirically. We do show that it is unfortunately possible to\nconstruct small adversarial biases in behavior that lead to arbitrarily large errors\nin the inferred reward. However, and arguably more importantly, we are also able\nto identify reasonable assumptions under which the reward inference error can be\nbounded linearly in the error in the human model. Finally, we verify our theoretical\ninsights in discrete and continuous control tasks with simulated and human data.\n1 I NTRODUCTION",
  "summary": "### Structured Overview of the Paper\n\n#### **Introduction and Motivation**\nThe paper, presented at ICLR 2023, addresses a critical challenge in aligning AI objectives with human values: the sensitivity of reward inference to inaccuracies in human behavior models. Reward inference, a cornerstone of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), relies on modeling human behavior to deduce underlying reward functions. However, creating accurate human models is difficult due to systematic biases identified in cognitive science and behavioral economics, such as myopia, optimism bias, and prospect theory. This raises a fundamental question: how accurate must these models be to ensure reliable reward inference?\n\n#### **Key Contributions**\n1. **Theoretical Insights**:\n   - The authors demonstrate that small errors in human behavior models can, in adversarial scenarios, lead to arbitrarily large errors in inferred rewards. However, they argue that such adversarial cases are unlikely in practice.\n   - They identify conditions under which the error in inferred rewards is linearly bounded by the error in the human model, implying that improving human models consistently enhances reward inference accuracy.\n\n2. **Empirical Validation**:\n   - Using diagnostic gridworld tasks, the Lunar Lander game, and real human demonstration data, the authors show that under realistic biases, small inaccuracies in human models do not cause significant reward errors. This supports the theoretical findings and highlights the feasibility of reward learning under natural human biases.\n\n3. **Connection to Prior Work**:\n   - The study builds on Maximum-Entropy (MaxEnt) IRL, which models humans as noisily optimal decision-makers, and connects it to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The authors address challenges like reward identifiability but assume datasets avoid such ambiguities to focus on model misspecification.\n\n4. **Practical Implications**:\n   - The findings suggest an optimistic outlook for reward learning, emphasizing that refining human behavior models will improve AI alignment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Related Work**\nThe paper situates itself within a rich body of research on IRL, human behavior modeling, and decision-making:\n1. **Human Behavior and Biases**:\n   - Prior studies have shown that incorporating human biases (e.g., risk sensitivity, irrationality) into reward learning improves accuracy.\n   - Challenges include learning general biases across tasks and understanding specific types of irrationality.\n\n2. **Inverse Problems and Model Misspecification**:\n   - Research in Bayesian inverse problems highlights the brittleness of inference under model misspecification, motivating the need for robust reward learning methods.\n\n3. **Advancements in IRL**:\n   - The study builds on foundational IRL methods, including MaxEnt IRL and adversarial IRL, while addressing limitations in reward identifiability and model robustness.\n\n---\n\n#### **Problem Setup**\nThe study is framed within the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework:\n1. **MDP Components**:\n   - States (\\(S\\)), actions (\\(A\\)), dynamics (\\(P\\)), rewards (\\(r\\)), and a discount factor (\\(\\gamma\\)).\n   - The reward function \\(r(s, a)\\) is unknown and parameterized by \\(\\theta\\), which must be inferred.\n\n2. **Human Policy**:\n   - The true human policy (\\(\\pi^*\\)) generates demonstration data, while the learner assumes a model (\\(\\hat{\\pi}\\)), often a Boltzmann rational policy. However, \\(\\pi^*\\) may reflect human biases and irrationality.\n\n3. **Reward Inference via MLE**:\n   - Reward parameters (\\(\\hat{\\theta}\\)) are inferred by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the assumed policy (\\(\\hat{\\pi}\\)).\n\n4. **Goal**:\n   - To bound the error in inferred rewards (\\(d_\\theta(\\theta^*, \\hat{\\theta})\\)) as a function of the error in the assumed human model (\\(d_\\pi(\\pi^*, \\hat{\\pi})\\)).\n\n---\n\n#### **Theoretical Results**\n1. **Instability in Reward Inference**:\n   - Small errors in the assumed human model can lead to large errors in inferred rewards under adversarial conditions. However, such scenarios are unlikely in practice.\n\n2. **Stability Under Log-Concavity**:\n   - If the true and model policies are strongly log-concave with respect to reward parameters, the reward inference error is linearly bounded by the weighted policy divergence. This assumption holds for many natural human biases.\n\n3. **Bias-Specific Bounds**:\n   - **Transition Model Bias**: Errors in the human's internal dynamics model lead to bounded policy divergence and reward inference error.\n   - **Myopia Bias**: Overvaluing near-term rewards results in bounded errors proportional to the bias in the discount factor.\n\n---\n\n#### **Empirical Analysis**\nThe authors validate their theoretical findings through experiments in both tabular and continuous control environments:\n1. **Gridworld Experiments**:\n   - Simulated biases (e.g., internal dynamics, myopia) show that small policy divergences correspond to small reward inference errors, with sub-linear trends observed.\n\n2. **Lunar Lander Experiments**:\n   - Continuous control tasks confirm the trends observed in gridworld, with additional insights into the impact of learning demonstrator biases.\n\n3. **Real Human Data**:\n   - Human demonstrations in a discrete Lunar Lander environment reveal that natural biases (e.g., failing to account for gravity) still allow for accurate reward inference under the proposed conditions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Key Findings**\n1. **Worst-Case vs. Average-Case**:\n   - While adversarial scenarios can lead to unbounded errors, practical settings with natural biases often result in stable reward inference.\n\n2. **Bias-Specific Insights**:\n   - Transition model and myopia biases provide concrete bounds on policy divergence and reward inference error, offering insights into how human irrationalities affect learning.\n\n3. **Practical Implications**:\n   - The results highlight the importance of improving human behavior models to enhance reward learning and AI alignment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Limitations and Future Work**\n1. **Assumptions**:\n   - The analysis relies on log-concavity and reward identifiability, which may not always hold. Future work could explore weaker assumptions and address ambiguity in reward identification.\n\n2. **Robustness**:\n   - Developing reward inference algorithms that are robust to model misspecifications remains an open challenge.\n\n3. **Human Bias Modeling**:\n   - Further research is needed to better understand and model human biases, particularly in complex, real-world scenarios.\n\n---\n\n#### **Conclusion**\nThe paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of reward inference to human model inaccuracies, offering both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation. It highlights the risks of model misspecification while demonstrating that under reasonable assumptions, errors in inferred rewards are bounded. The findings underscore the importance of refining human behavior models to improve reward learning and AI alignment, paving the way for more robust and reliable AI systems.",
