  "summary": "### Overview of FETCH: A Novel Framework for Automated Feature Engineering\n\nThe paper, presented at ICLR 2023, introduces **FETCH (FEature SET Data-Driven Search)**, a groundbreaking framework for automated feature engineering (AutoFE) tailored for tabular data. FETCH addresses key limitations in existing AutoFE methods by adopting a **data-driven Markov Decision Process (MDP)** setup and leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to iteratively generate and refine features. The framework is inspired by human experts' ability to analyze datasets and transfer knowledge across tasks, offering a more efficient, interpretable, and transferable solution for feature engineering.\n\n---\n\n### Key Contributions\n\n1. **Data-Driven MDP Setup**:\n   - FETCH directly observes and analyzes tabular datasets as the state input to a policy network, mimicking human experts. This contrasts with traditional NAS-like AutoFE methods (e.g., NFS, DIFER), which are \"data-unobserved\" and generate feature engineering (FE) plans without directly analyzing the data.\n\n2. **Transferability**:\n   - FETCH introduces a pre-training paradigm for AutoFE, enabling the policy network to generalize across unseen datasets. By training on diverse datasets, FETCH accumulates knowledge that can be applied to new datasets with minimal exploration, significantly improving efficiency and performance.\n\n3. **Improved Performance**:\n   - Extensive experiments demonstrate that FETCH systematically outperforms state-of-the-art AutoFE methods, achieving superior results in both classification and regression tasks. Its ability to generate higher-order features and optimize feature sets leads to better model fitting and generalization.\n\n4. **Interpretability and Flexibility**:\n   - FETCH generates features with interpretable names based on their construction paths, aiding expert understanding. It also supports variable-length and permutation-invariant tabular data, making it highly adaptable to real-world datasets.\n\n---\n\n### FETCH's Workflow and Architecture\n\n#### **Core Workflow**:\n- FETCH formulates feature engineering as a control problem using RL. The framework employs a policy network to map input data tables to optimal FE actions, iteratively refining these actions to create higher-order features.\n- The RL setup includes:\n  - **State**: The dataset or its bootstrapped version.\n  - **Actions**: Feature transformation operations (e.g., addition, deletion, or transformation of columns).\n  - **Reward Function**: Evaluates the quality of the FE plan based on cross-validation performance metrics (e.g., F1-score).\n\n#### **Policy Network**:\n- Inspired by Transformer models, the policy network includes:\n  - A fully connected network (FCN) to standardize feature vector dimensions.\n  - A multi-head self-attention module (without positional encoding) to capture relationships between features while maintaining permutation invariance.\n  - An action decoder and softmax layer to map feature relationships to action probabilities.\n\n#### **Training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:\n- FETCH uses PPO to train the policy network, optimizing feature selection and generation. The reward function combines average cross-validation performance with a penalty term for suboptimal results, improving training stability and sample efficiency.\n\n#### **Pre-Training and Transferability**:\n- FETCH is pre-trained on diverse datasets with varying schemas, row/column sizes, and structures. This enables the model to generalize to unseen datasets, akin to pre-training paradigms in NLP (e.g., BERT) and vision (e.g., SimCLR). Unlike traditional pre-training, FETCH does not require standardized input shapes, making it highly flexible for real-world tabular data.\n\n---\n\n### Experimental Results\n\n#### **Performance Across Datasets**:\n- FETCH was evaluated on 27 datasets (11 regression, 16 classification) from OpenML, UCI, and Kaggle. It outperformed state-of-the-art AutoFE methods (e.g., DIFER, NFS) on 25 out of 27 datasets and ranked second on the remaining two.\n- Example results:\n  - **Airfoil (Regression)**: FETCH scored 0.6463, outperforming DIFER (0.6125) and NFS (0.6226).\n  - **Adult Income (Classification)**: FETCH scored 0.8537, slightly below AutoGluon (0.8738) but above DIFER (0.8584).\n\n#### **Transferability**:\n- FETCH demonstrated significant improvements when pre-trained on diverse datasets:\n  - Pre-trained models achieved higher scores earlier in the training process, with the largest performance gap around 150 epochs.\n  - Example improvements:\n    - **Housing Boston**: 2.31% improvement with pre-trained models.\n    - **OpenML 616**: 4.67% improvement.\n    - **Wine Quality Red**: 2.59% improvement.\n\n#### **Scalability and Efficiency**:\n- FETCH was tested on large datasets (e.g., Medical Charges, Give Me Some Credit, Poker Hand) with over 50K rows. It achieved the highest scores compared to NFS and DIFER within a 2-day runtime.\n- FETCH converged within 100-150 exploration epochs, making it **11x more sample-efficient** than NFS.\n\n#### **Flexibility Across Models**:\n- FETCH improved evaluation scores across various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), demonstrating its compatibility with different algorithms.\n\n---\n\n### Advantages of FETCH\n\n1. **Human-Like Feature Engineering**:\n   - FETCH bridges the gap between automated and manual feature engineering by directly analyzing datasets and iteratively refining features, emulating human experts.\n\n2. **Higher-Order Feature Generation**:\n   - FETCH supports recursive application of binary operations, enabling the creation of complex features (e.g., BMI as Weight/Height²).\n\n3. **Interpretability**:\n   - Generated features are named based on their construction paths, aiding expert understanding and real-world applicability.\n\n4. **Real-World Applicability**:\n   - FETCH handles variable-length and permutation-invariant tabular data, eliminating the need for standardized preprocessing.\n\n5. **Transferability**:\n   - FETCH's pre-training capability allows it to generalize across datasets, reducing computational costs and exploration time on new datasets.\n\n---\n\n### Limitations of Existing Methods Addressed by FETCH\n\n1. **Data-Unobserved Setup**:\n   - Traditional NAS-like AutoFE frameworks (e.g., NFS, DIFER) do not directly observe datasets, leading to data-unrelated FE plans. FETCH overcomes this by fully analyzing datasets before proposing FE actions.\n\n2. **Lack of Transferability**:\n   - Existing methods cannot leverage knowledge from prior datasets to accelerate feature engineering on new datasets. FETCH introduces a pre-training paradigm to address this gap.\n\n3. **Feature Dimension Explosion**:\n   - FETCH avoids the feature dimension explosion and computational inefficiency seen in prior methods by iteratively refining feature sets.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nFETCH establishes itself as a superior AutoFE framework, excelling in performance, transferability, and flexibility. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets and tasks, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications. Future work aims to scale FETCH to extremely large datasets and further explore its pre-training capabilities, including potential extensions to multimodal data.\n\nIn summary, FETCH represents a significant advancement in automated feature engineering, offering a novel, interpretable, and transferable solution for tabular data analysis.",
