    "title": "Time Will Tell: New Outlooks and A Baseline for Temporal Multi-View 3D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "While recent camera-only 3D detection methods leverage multiple timesteps, the limited history they use significantly hampers the extent to which temporal fusion can improve object perception. Observing that existing works' fusion of multi-frame images are instances of temporal stereo matching, we find that performance is hindered by the interplay between 1) the low granularity of matching resolution and 2) the sub-optimal multi-view setup produced by limited history usage. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly for different pixels and depths, making it necessary to fuse many timesteps over long-term history. Building on our investigation, we propose to generate a cost volume from a long history of image observations, compensating for the coarse but efficient matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view matching setup. Further, we augment the per-frame monocular depth predictions used for long-term, coarse matching with short-term, fine-grained matching and find that long and short term temporal fusion are highly complementary. While maintaining high efficiency, our framework sets new state-of-the-art on nuScenes, achieving first place on the test set and outperforming previous best art by 5.2% mAP and 3.7% NDS on the validation set. Code will be released here: https://github.com/Divadi/SOLOFusion.",
    "human_review": "Summary Of The Paper:\nIn this paper, the authors study vision only 3D object detection for autonomous driving. First, the authors formulate the recent multi-frame multi-view methods as temporal stereo matching. Then localisation potential is proposed and analysed theoretically and empirically to show the necessity of larger time window. To handle the efficiency of long term computation, coarser resolution feature maps are used in the long term and finer resolution in the short term. In the experiments, the proposed method outperforms others in nuScenes leaderboard.\n\nStrength And Weaknesses:\nStrengths:\n\nNew formulation of the exiting multi-view, multi-frame image based 3D detection methods.\n\nUse both theoretical and empirical analysis by introducing localisation potential, to unveil the importance of longer time horizon.\n\nImpressive performance in nuScenes leaderboard.\n\nWriting is clear and easy to follow.\n\nWeakness:\n\nI have one question regarding the experimental analysis. Did the authors analyse the performance improvement for objects with different speed? It is interesting to see the impact of long term fusion on static, slowly moving and fast moving objects.\n\nClarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility:\nClarity, Quality, Novelty:\n\nAs mentioned in the strengths, this paper is organised well and has several novel contributions. Overall, this is a high-quality paper.\n\nReproducibility:\n\nFrom Section 5, it seems not very difficult to reproduce the paper. However, we are still look forward to the officially released code.\n\nSummary Of The Review:\nI would like to accept this paper. If the authors can provide more analysis for the method (for example, the question I have in the weakness), I tend to further increase my rating.",
    "text_summary": "### Motivation\nThe paper introduces **SOLOFusion**, a novel framework for camera-only 3D object detection, addressing key limitations in temporal multi-view fusion for depth estimation. Existing methods typically rely on short temporal histories (2-3 seconds), which restrict their ability to fully leverage temporal data for improved object perception. The authors identify two primary challenges: (1) low granularity in matching resolution and (2) suboptimal multi-view setups due to limited historical data. Their analysis reveals that the optimal temporal difference between views varies significantly across pixels, depths, and camera setups, necessitating the use of long-term temporal data for better depth estimation. The study also connects temporal 3D detection to multi-view stereo (MVS) principles, providing a theoretical foundation for improving temporal fusion and feature resolution.\n\n### Method\nSOLOFusion combines short-term, high-resolution temporal fusion with long-term, low-resolution fusion to maximize localization potential while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework introduces several key innovations:\n\n1. **Unified Temporal Stereo Formulation**: The method integrates multi-view stereo principles with temporal fusion, leveraging both short-term and long-term temporal data for improved depth estimation and object localization.\n2. **Cost Volume Construction**: A 16-frame Bird’s Eye View (BEV) cost volume is generated from a long history of image observations, compensating for coarse matching resolution with a more optimal multi-view setup.\n3. **Gaussian-Spaced Top-k Sampling**: A novel sampling method balances exploration (diverse depth hypotheses) and exploitation (monocular priors) to efficiently generate depth candidates, reducing computational overhead.\n4. **Complementary Fusion Modules**:\n   - **Low-Resolution, Long-Term Temporal Stereo**: Uses coarse 1/16 resolution image features and a long history of timesteps to generate a dense point cloud and voxelize it into a BEV feature map.\n   - **High-Resolution, Short-Term Temporal Stereo**: Combines monocular depth predictions with stereo matching at 1/4 resolution for improved depth estimation.\n\nThe framework balances spatial resolution and temporal differences, leveraging improvements in one dimension (resolution or temporal history) to offset limitations in the other.\n\n### Results\nSOLOFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **nuScenes dataset**, which includes 750 training, 150 validation, and 150 testing scenes captured with six cameras. Key results include:\n\n1. **State-of-the-Art Performance**:\n   - SOLOFusion ranks **1st** on the nuScenes test set camera-only track, achieving **5.2% mAP** and **3.7% NDS** improvements over prior methods on the validation set.\n   - It outperforms strong baselines like BEVDepth and BEVStereo, particularly in multi-view localization and velocity estimation.\n\n2. **Impact of Temporal Fusion**:\n   - Long-term fusion significantly improves detection metrics, with mAP increasing by **43.6%** and mATE decreasing by **15.7%** for static objects when aggregating 16 timesteps.\n   - For moving objects, long-term fusion enhances orientation and velocity estimation, with mAOE decreasing by **20.9%** and mAVE by **23.3%**.\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - SOLOFusion achieves **12.2 FPS** with a memory usage of **3.3 GB**, outperforming competitors like STS in runtime efficiency while maintaining superior localization accuracy.\n\n4. **Ablation Studies**:\n   - Increasing the number of timesteps improves performance, with mAP rising from **0.307** (0 timesteps) to **0.377** (16 timesteps).\n   - The Gaussian-Spaced Top-k Sampling method achieves the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, with mAP of **0.343** and runtime of **11.4 FPS**.\n\n5. **Tracking and Downstream Applications**:\n   - SOLOFusion achieves **0.540 AMOTA** and **0.941 AMOTP** on the nuScenes test set for tracking tasks, demonstrating its potential for applications like forecasting and planning.\n\n### Conclusion\nSOLOFusion advances camera-only 3D object detection by addressing the limitations of existing temporal fusion methods and integrating multi-view stereo principles. By leveraging long-term temporal data and balancing spatial and temporal factors, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in precision and localization. Its ability to improve both static and dynamic object detection, while maintaining efficient runtime and memory usage, highlights its potential for autonomous driving applications. Future work will focus on refining velocity predictions and exploring their impact on moving object detection. The code for SOLOFusion will be made publicly available, enabling further research and development in this domain.",
