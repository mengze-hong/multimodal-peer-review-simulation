    "title": "​​Scaling Up Probabilistic Circuits by Latent Variable Distillation",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a unified framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various probabilistic queries (e.g., marginal probabilities). One key challenge is to scale PCs to model large and high-dimensional real-world datasets: we observe that as the number of parameters in PCs increases, their performance immediately plateaus. This phenomenon suggests that the existing optimizers fail to exploit the full expressive power of large PCs. We propose to overcome such bottleneck by latent variable distillation: we leverage the less tractable but more expressive deep generative models to provide extra supervision over the latent variables of PCs. Specifically, we extract information from Transformer-based generative models to assign values to latent variables of PCs, providing guidance to PC optimizers. Experiments on both image and language modeling benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet and WikiText-2) show that latent variable distillation substantially boosts the performance of large PCs compared to their counterparts without latent variable distillation. In particular, on the image modeling benchmarks, PCs achieve competitive performance against some of the widely-used deep generative models, including variational autoencoders and flow-based models, opening up new avenues for tractable generative modeling.

    "human_review": "Summary Of The Paper:\nThis paper is about improving the expressivity of large scale probabilistic circuits (PCs). Finding a good starting point for EM based learning of these large latent variable models is problematic and the authors propose one such solution to this problem. The main idea is to obtain semantic-aware assignments (called supervision) to the latent variables from less tractable deep generative models and then perform maximum likelihood learning over the data combined with these newly assigned latent variables. The variables that receive these assignments are said to be materialized and the assignments themselves are generated by a deep generative model by clustering over the latent embeddings of the observed (sub)space(s). When all the latent variables have been assigned values, the optimization (MLE) can be performed in closed form. The result of MLE serves as a starting point for optimizing the data likelihood in the following steps. The authors propose a couple of techniques to efficiently compute the MLE parameters which include exploiting conditional independency achieved by materialized latent variables and fine tuning the latent distributions only while keeping the parameters learned over the observed space fixed. On CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, the proposed method has shown superior performance compared to other SoTA TPMs learners and were comparable to less tractable but expressive flow-based models and VAEs.\n\nStrength And Weaknesses:\nStrengths:\n\na novel method to improve the performance of large scale probabilistic circuits.\nmotivating empirical evaluations on three image datasets to show the performance improvements over very large circuits.\nclear writeup with good examples.\n\nWeaknesses: I didn't find major weaknesses in the technical aspects of the paper. Please see some questions and comments below.\n\nClarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility:\nThe paper is well written with illustrative examples. I found the idea to be novel and the authors have detailed their experimental setups for reproducibility.\n\nSummary Of The Review:\nThe authors have addressed an important practical issue with large scale probabilistic circuits. The expressivity of these models tend to plateau once a certain capacity is reached typically in the order of millions of parameters. With such large scale circuits of deeply nested latent variables, the optimization landscape becomes very complex and finding a local minima becomes hard. The main idea in the paper is to make latent variables observed by assigning them values and performing an optimization step that works on less number of latent variables. This will give the EM step a good starting point. I found the idea to obtain latent variable assignments using a deep generative model to be interesting. The method seems to be effective according to the empirical results presented in the paper.\n\nQuestions:\na) In the introduction it is stated that the expressive power of PCs should monotonically increase with respect to the number of parameters. I am curious if these models don't suffer from overfitting issues. Maybe the authors could comment on this aspect.\nb) Did all the models have the same structure?\nc) Could the method be useful for smaller scale PCs? It seems that the clustering in the latent embedding is the key reason behind the performance boost of LVDs.\nd) The significant speed up in training (for all the datasets) should probably be presented in the paper since it is mentioned in the introduction.\ne) Have you done any analysis on the number of LVs that were materialized and the performance of the PCs?\n\nCorrectness: 3: Some of the paper’s claims have minor issues. A few statements are not well-supported, or require small changes to be made correct.\nTechnical Novelty And Significance: 4: The contributions are significant, and do not exist in prior works.\nEmpirical Novelty And Significance: 4: The contributions are significant, and do not exist in prior works.\nFlag For Ethics Review: NO.\nRecommendation: 8: accept, good paper\nConfidence: 4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

    "text_summary": "### Motivation\nThe paper, presented at ICLR 2023, addresses the challenge of scaling **Probabilistic Circuits (PCs)** and **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** for large, high-dimensional datasets. PCs are a class of **tractable probabilistic models (TPMs)** that efficiently compute queries like marginal probabilities. However, as the number of parameters in PCs increases, their performance plateaus due to the limitations of current optimization methods in utilizing their full expressive power. Similarly, HMMs struggle to optimize large latent spaces effectively. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose **Latent Variable Distillation (LVD)**, a novel framework that leverages **deep generative models (DGMs)** to guide the optimization of PCs and HMMs, enabling better utilization of model capacity and improved scalability.\n\n---\n\n### Method\n#### Latent Variable Distillation (LVD)\nLVD enhances the training of PCs and HMMs by distilling information from expressive but less tractable DGMs (e.g., Transformer-based models or Masked Autoencoders). The process involves three key steps:\n\n1. **Materializing Latent Variables (LVs)**:\n   - PCs and HMMs are augmented with explicit latent variables \\( Z \\), creating a joint distribution \\( p(X, Z) \\), where \\( X \\) represents observed variables.\n   - The latent variables are materialized based on subsets of observed variables defined by the model structure, ensuring interpretability and tractability.\n\n2. **Inducing LV Assignments**:\n   - A DGM (e.g., BERT for text or MAEs for images) is used to assign semantics-aware values to the latent variables.\n   - For example, in HMMs, contextualized embeddings from BERT are clustered using K-means, and cluster IDs are assigned as latent variable values. In PCs, image patches are clustered based on MAE-generated features.\n\n3. **Parameter Learning**:\n   - The augmented dataset \\( D_{\\text{aug}} = \\{(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)})\\} \\) is used to optimize a lower-bound objective \\( \\sum_i \\log p(x^{(i)}, z^{(i)}) \\), which approximates the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective \\( \\sum_i \\log p(x^{(i)}) \\).\n   - Parameters are initialized using closed-form solutions or Expectation-Maximization (EM) and fine-tuned on the original dataset.\n\n#### Application to HMMs\n- HMMs are trained on token sequences (e.g., from the WikiText-2 dataset) with latent variables assigned using BERT embeddings. The augmented dataset is used to optimize the model parameters, enabling better utilization of hidden states and improved perplexity on language modeling tasks.\n\n#### Application to PCs\n- PCs are structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with sum and product units, ensuring tractability through constraints like **smoothness** and **decomposability**.\n- LVD assigns latent variables to sum units, transforming them into deterministic units with disjoint supports, simplifying optimization. The latent-conditioned distributions \\( p(X_i | Z_i) \\) and the overall latent distribution \\( p(Z) \\) are optimized independently, reducing computational complexity.\n\n---\n\n### Results\n#### Language Modeling (HMMs)\n- **Dataset**: WikiText-2.\n- **Setup**: HMMs with varying numbers of hidden states (\\( h = 128, 256, 512, 750, 1024, 1250 \\)) were trained with and without LVD.\n- **Findings**:\n  - HMMs trained with random initialization plateau in performance as the number of parameters increases.\n  - HMMs trained with LVD progressively improve, achieving lower perplexity and demonstrating effective utilization of larger model capacities.\n\n#### Image Modeling (PCs)\n- **Datasets**: CIFAR, ImageNet32, and ImageNet64.\n- **Performance**:\n  - On **ImageNet32**, LVD-trained PCs achieve 4.39 bits-per-dimension (bpd), outperforming TPM baselines like Hidden Chow-Liu Trees (HCLTs), Einsum Networks (EiNet), and Random Sum-Product Networks (RAT-SPN).\n  - LVD-trained PCs are competitive with DGMs like Glow and RealNVP, with bpd gaps of ∼0.1 to ∼0.3.\n  - LVD scales effectively with model size, achieving significant performance gains for PCs with up to 500M parameters.\n\n#### Efficiency\n- LVD reduces training time for large PCs. For example, training a 500M parameter PC on CIFAR takes ~10 GPU hours with LVD, compared to over a day with existing optimizers. This efficiency is achieved by leveraging the conditional independence introduced by materialized latent variables.\n\n#### Generalization\n- LVD is versatile and applicable to various TPMs. For instance, it improves HMM performance on language modeling tasks and enables PCs to achieve competitive results on image modeling benchmarks. The method also demonstrates scalability, with performance improving as model size increases.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe paper introduces **Latent Variable Distillation (LVD)**, a framework that enhances the training of Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) by leveraging deep generative models. LVD addresses the challenges of optimizing large latent spaces, enabling better utilization of model capacity and improved scalability. Key contributions include:\n1. A novel method for materializing and optimizing latent variables in PCs and HMMs.\n2. Demonstration of LVD's effectiveness on image and language modeling tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among TPMs and competitive results against DGMs.\n3. Significant improvements in training efficiency, making it feasible to scale PCs to larger datasets and models.\n\nBy integrating tractable probabilistic models with neural networks, LVD opens new possibilities for scalable and interpretable generative modeling.

Such experiments would provide stronger evidence of the method's scalability.\n\n5. **Interpretability Trade-offs**:\n   - While LVD enhances interpretability by materializing latent variables, the use of DGMs for latent variable assignment may obscure the interpretability of the overall pipeline. This trade-off is not discussed in the paper.\n\n#### 4. Clarity & Reproducibility\n- **Clarity**:\n   - The paper is well-written and clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and results.
