    "title": "Neuroevolution is a Competitive Alternative to Reinforcement Learning for Skill Discovery ",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training neural policies to solve complex control tasks. However, these policies tend to be overfit to the exact specifications of the task and environment they were trained on, and thus do not perform well when conditions deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex tasks. Recent work has shown that training a mixture of policies, as opposed to a single one, that are driven to explore different regions of the state-action space can address this shortcoming by generating a diverse set of behaviors, referred to as skills, that can be collectively used to great effect in adaptation tasks or for hierarchical planning. This is typically realized by including a diversity term - often derived from information theory - in the objective function optimized by RL. However these approaches often require careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate that less widely-used neuroevolution methods, specifically Quality Diversity (QD), are a competitive alternative to information-theory-augmented RL for skill discovery. Through an extensive empirical evaluation comparing eight state-of-the-art algorithms (four flagship algorithms from each line of work) on the basis of (i) metrics directly evaluating the skills' diversity, (ii) the skills' performance on adaptation tasks, and (iii) the skills' performance when used as primitives for hierarchical planning; QD methods are found to provide equal, and sometimes improved, performance whilst being less sensitive to hyperparameters and more scalable. As no single method is found to provide near-optimal performance across all environments, there is a rich scope for further research which we support by proposing future directions and providing optimized open-source implementations.",
    "human_review": "Summary Of The Paper: This paper studies the implicit bias of gradient flow and gradient descent in two-layer fully connected neural networks with leaky ReLU activations under nearly-orthogonal data. It shows gradient flow leads to rank ≤2 networks and a single gradient descent step already reduces rank, which stays small during training. Experiments support the theory. Strength And Weaknesses: Strengths: Good characterization of implicit bias for leaky ReLU networks in high-dimensional settings; shows importance of small initialization variance. Weaknesses: Lacks precise definition and quantification of 'high-dimensional' and 'near-orthogonality'; heavily adapts tools from prior work (Lyu & Li 2019; Ji & Telgarsky 2020; Lyu et al. 2021); unclear if implicit bias is intrinsic to the network; missing related works on (leaky) ReLU networks such as Laurent et al. (2018), Wang et al. (2019), Yang et al. (2021), Ergen & Pilanci (2020); unclear extension to deeper networks. Comments: (i) Only two-layer leaky ReLU considered; comparison to deeper/ReLU networks desired. (ii) Fixing second-layer simplifies optimization—discussion on full-learnable 2-layer case missing. (iii) Need comparison of offline vs online (Lyu & Li, Ji & Telgarsky). (iv) Experiments only on CIFAR-10—more datasets needed. (v) Minor grammar issues. Clarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility: Clear but can improve; assumptions unclear; related work discussion insufficient, making novelty hard to judge. Summary Of The Review: Interesting theoretical results on leaky ReLU implicit bias but needs broader comparisons, clearer assumptions, and deeper network discussion. Initially below ICLR bar but improved after rebuttal. Correctness: 4. Technical Novelty: 2. Empirical Novelty: 3. Ethics Flag: NO. Recommendation: 8 (accept). Confidence: 4.",
    "text_summary": "### Motivation\nThe paper, presented at ICLR 2023, explores the potential of Quality Diversity (QD) optimization as a competitive alternative to reinforcement learning (RL) for skill discovery in sequential decision-making tasks. While RL has been effective in training neural policies for complex control tasks, it often suffers from overfitting to specific task conditions, leading to poor generalization. A promising solution involves training a mixture of policies to explore diverse regions of the state-action space, generating a variety of behaviors (skills) for adaptation or hierarchical planning. RL-based approaches typically achieve this by incorporating diversity terms into the objective function, but these methods are computationally sensitive and require careful hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, QD methods, originating from evolutionary optimization, focus on generating diverse, high-performing solutions and are less sensitive to hyperparameters, making them more scalable.\n\n### Method\nThe study evaluates eight state-of-the-art skill-discovery algorithms—four from RL (e.g., DIAYN, DADS, SMERL) and four from QD (e.g., MAP-Elites, PGA-MAP-Elites, AURORA, PGA-AURORA)—across three criteria: (i) diversity of skills, (ii) performance on adaptation tasks, and (iii) utility as primitives for hierarchical planning. The methods are implemented using the JAX framework for hardware acceleration, enabling efficient training on large-scale environments.\n\n#### RL-Based Methods\n- **DIAYN and DADS**: Maximize mutual information (MI) between latent variables and trajectory components, using intrinsic rewards derived from discriminators or skill-dynamics models.\n- **SMERL Variants**: Extend DIAYN and DADS by constraining diversity maximization to policies within an epsilon margin of optimal returns, balancing diversity and task performance.\n- **Reward-Augmented Variants**: Combine task rewards with intrinsic rewards to enhance performance.\n\n#### QD-Based Methods\n- **MAP-Elites and PGA-MAP-Elites**: Maintain a discrete repertoire of independent policies, updated using genetic mutations and policy-gradient updates.\n- **AURORA and PGA-AURORA**: Use unsupervised behavior descriptor spaces learned via autoencoders, combined with genetic and policy-gradient updates for improved diversity and performance.\n\n### Experiments\nThe study benchmarks the algorithms across diverse environments, including:\n- **Unidirectional tasks**: Robots trained to run forward with diverse gaits.\n- **Omnidirectional tasks**: Robots moving in a 2D plane while minimizing control energy.\n- **Maze navigation tasks**: Robots navigating mazes to reach target positions.\n- **Adaptation tasks**: Evaluating robustness to environmental changes (e.g., gravity variations, leg dysfunction).\n- **Hierarchical planning tasks**: Using learned skills as primitives for complex tasks like jumping over hurdles.\n\n#### Metrics\n- **QD Score**: Sum of fitness scores across the repertoire.\n- **Coverage**: Number of behavior niches filled.\n- **Maximum Fitness**: Highest fitness score in the repertoire.\n\n### Results\n1. **Performance Comparison**:\n   - QD methods generally outperform RL-based methods in QD score and coverage, particularly in exploration-heavy tasks like maze navigation.\n   - RL-based methods achieve higher maximum fitness in some tasks but struggle with diversity and robustness.\n   - PGA-MAP-Elites and PGA-AURORA demonstrate strong performance across diverse tasks, balancing exploration and exploitation effectively.\n\n2. **Adaptation and Robustness**:\n   - QD methods, especially PGA-MAP-Elites, show superior adaptability to environmental changes, maintaining performance under extreme perturbations.\n   - RL-based methods like SMERL excel in small perturbations but falter in more challenging scenarios.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Planning**:\n   - Skills learned by QD methods enable effective hierarchical planning, with meta-controllers successfully solving complex tasks like hurdle jumping.\n\n4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**:\n   - QD methods are less sensitive to hyperparameter variations compared to RL-based methods, making them more robust and easier to deploy.\n\n5. **Unsupervised Behavior Discovery**:\n   - AURORA and PGA-AURORA achieve competitive performance without relying on predefined behavior descriptors, highlighting the potential of unsupervised methods.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe paper demonstrates that QD methods are competitive with, and often superior to, RL-based methods for skill discovery, particularly in terms of diversity, robustness, and scalability. While RL methods excel in specific tasks requiring high fitness, QD methods provide a more balanced approach, excelling in exploration and adaptability. The study highlights the potential for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of QD and RL, such as integrating intrinsic rewards from RL into QD frameworks. The authors provide open-source implementations and propose future research directions to further explore the synergy between QD and RL for skill discovery in complex environments.",

The emphasis on QD methods as a scalable and robust alternative to RL is a significant contribution.\n- **Significance**: The findings have broad implications for the field of sequential decision-making, particularly in robotics and hierarchical planning.
