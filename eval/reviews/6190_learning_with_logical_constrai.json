    "abstract": "Recent studies have started to explore the integration of logical knowledge into deep learning via encoding logical constraints as an additional loss function. However, existing approaches tend to vacuously satisfy logical constraints through shortcuts, failing to fully exploit the knowledge. In this paper, we present a new framework for learning with logical constraints. Specifically, we address the shortcut satisfaction issue by introducing dual variables for logical connectives, encoding how the constraint is satisfied. We further propose a variational framework where the encoded logical constraint is expressed as a distributional loss that is compatible with the model's original training loss.

    "text_summary": "### Structured Summary of the Paper\n\n---\n\n#### **Motivation**\nThe paper addresses the challenge of integrating logical constraints into deep learning models while avoiding the \"shortcut satisfaction\" problem. This issue arises when models satisfy constraints in trivial or unintended ways, such as assigning false values to variables, rather than learning meaningful relationships. For example, in a semi-supervised handwritten digit classification task, a logical rule \\( P \\to Q \\) (e.g., if a rotated image is classified as '9', then the original image should be classified as '6') is often vacuously satisfied by setting \\( P = \\text{False} \\) for all inputs, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalization. Existing methods, which encode logical constraints as additional loss terms, often fail to differentiate between meaningful and trivial ways of satisfying constraints, resulting in overfitting to easy solutions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Method**\nThe authors propose a novel framework to integrate logical constraints into deep learning models, ensuring meaningful satisfaction of constraints while maintaining compatibility with the original training loss. Key innovations include:\n\n1. **Dual Variables for Logical Connectives**:\n   - Logical constraints are expressed in conjunctive normal form (CNF), and dual variables are introduced to represent the satisfaction levels of individual components. For example, in \\( \\neg P \\lor Q \\), dual variables \\( \\tau_1 \\) and \\( \\tau_2 \\) indicate the satisfaction levels of \\( \\neg P \\) and \\( Q \\), respectively.\n\n2. **Convex Combinations for Logical Operations**:\n   - Logical conjunctions and disjunctions are converted into convex combinations of individual loss functions. This ensures monotonicity, meaning that reducing the loss increases the degree of satisfaction, unlike existing methods that only guarantee full satisfaction when the loss is zero.\n\n3. **Variational Framework**:\n   - A random variable is introduced to represent the satisfaction degree of the logical constraint. The logical loss is formulated as a distributional loss, which is compatible with the model's original training loss. The optimization problem is framed as a competitive game between the model parameters and the dual variables, solved using a stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SGDA) algorithm. Theoretical analysis guarantees convergence to a superset of local Nash equilibria, addressing incompatibility issues in prior methods.\n\n4. **Logical Cost Functions**:\n   - Logical conjunctions and disjunctions are encoded as optimization problems using dual variables. For conjunctions, the cost function \\( S_\\land(l) \\) is defined as the maximum of individual costs, while for disjunctions, \\( S_\\lor(l) \\) is defined as the minimum. These formulations ensure robustness, interpretability, and monotonicity.\n\n5. **KL Divergence and Distributional Loss**:\n   - The framework minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true conditional probability distribution \\( p(y, z|x) \\) and the model's predicted distribution \\( p_w(y, z|x) \\). Logical constraints are incorporated into the loss function using truncated normal distributions, ensuring compatibility with the original training objectives.\n\n---\n\n#### **Results**\nThe proposed method was evaluated on multiple tasks, demonstrating superior performance in terms of accuracy, logical constraint satisfaction, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods. Key results include:\n\n1. **Handwritten Digit Recognition**:\n   - A semi-supervised classification task on MNIST, with labels for the digit '6' removed, used a logical rule \\( (f(\\tilde{x}) \\neq 9) \\lor (f(x) = 6) \\). The method achieved:\n     - **Accuracy**: 98.8%, comparable to fully supervised training.\n     - **Constraint Satisfaction**: Successfully satisfied \\( Q \\) when \\( P \\) held for class '6', unlike existing methods (e.g., DL2) that vacuously satisfied the rule by discouraging \\( P \\) for all inputs.\n\n2. **Handwritten Formula Recognition**:\n   - Predicting mathematical formulas from images while ensuring logical constraints (e.g., no two adjacent operators). In a semi-supervised setting with limited labeled data, the method achieved:\n     - **Accuracy**: 98.8% (2% labeled data), 98.8% (5% labeled data).\n     - **Constraint Satisfaction**: 98.9% (2% labeled data), 90.5% (5% labeled data).\n\n3. **Shortest Distance Prediction**:\n   - A regression task predicting the shortest path length in a weighted graph while satisfying symmetry and triangle inequality constraints. The method achieved:\n     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 7.09.\n     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 1.87.\n     - **Constraint Satisfaction**: 69.0%, outperforming competing methods.\n\n4. **CIFAR100 Image Classification**:\n   - Logical constraints ensured superclass probabilities aligned with class predictions. Using 10,000 labeled and 30,000 unlabeled examples, the method achieved:\n     - **Class Accuracy**: Outperformed competitors across architectures (e.g., VGG16: 53.4% ± 0.43 vs. baseline 51.0% ± 0.52).\n     - **Constraint Satisfaction**: Highest satisfaction rates (e.g., VGG16: 81.1% ± 0.37 vs. baseline 63.0% ± 0.74).\n\n5. **Transfer Learning**:\n   - Tested on STL10 using a ResNet18 model trained on CIFAR10. Logical constraints improved:\n     - **Class Accuracy**: 65.8% → 68.1% (CIFAR10), 32.6% → 35.4% (STL10).\n     - **Superclass Accuracy**: 92.7% → 93.9% (CIFAR10), 76.4% → 78.1% (STL10).\n\n6. **Runtime Efficiency**:\n   - Minimal additional computational cost compared to the baseline. For example, on CIFAR100:\n     - VGG16: 30.2s (baseline) vs. 32.5s (proposed).\n     - ResNet50: 26.4s (baseline) vs. 27.0s (proposed).\n\n---\n\n#### **Conclusion**\nThe paper introduces a principled framework for integrating logical constraints into deep learning models, addressing the shortcut satisfaction problem and improving generalization. Key contributions include:\n1. A novel logic-to-loss translation method that avoids trivial solutions by considering how constraints are satisfied.\n2. A variational framework that jointly trains logical and original losses with guaranteed convergence.\n3. Extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance in accuracy, logical constraint satisfaction, and generalization across multiple tasks.\n\nThe method enhances interpretability, robustness, and compatibility with standard training objectives, making it a practical approach for real-world applications. Future work could explore alternative distributions for logical constraints and automatic logic induction from raw data.",
