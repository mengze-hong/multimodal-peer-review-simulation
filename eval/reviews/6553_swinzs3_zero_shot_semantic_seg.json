    "title": "SwinZS3: Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation with a Swin Transformer ",
    "abstract": "Inferring reward functions from human behavior is at the center of value alignment – aligning AI objectives with what we, humans, actually want. But doing so relies on models of how humans behave given their objectives. After decades of research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and behavioral economics, obtaining accurate human models remains an open research topic. This begs the question: how accurate do these models need to be in order for the reward inference to be accurate? On the one hand, if small errors in the model can lead to catastrophic error in inference, the entire framework of reward learning seems ill-fated, as we will never have perfect models of human behavior. On the other hand, if as our models improve, we can have a guarantee that reward accuracy also improves, this would show the benefit of more work on the modeling side. We study this question both theoretically and empirically. We do show that it is unfortunately possible to construct small adversarial biases in behavior that lead to arbitrarily large errors in the inferred reward. However, and arguably more importantly, we are also able to identify reasonable assumptions under which the reward inference error can be bounded linearly in the error in the human model. Finally, we verify our theoretical insights in discrete and continuous control tasks with simulated and human data.",
    "human_review": "Summary Of The Paper:\nThe paper proposes a transformer-based approach for zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3). The method employs multiple loss components: a cross-entropy loss for seen classes, a regression loss aligning language and visual features to handle unseen classes, a pixel-text score map to mitigate seen-class bias, and a semantic consistency loss to transfer relationships from word2vec embeddings to the semantic prototypes of the learned embedding space. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC and Context datasets.\n\nStrength And Weaknesses:\n\nStrengths:\n- The method demonstrates reasonable improvements over competitive baselines and achieves strong results on standard benchmarks.\n- The introduction of a pixel-text score map to alleviate seen-class bias is an interesting and valuable contribution.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper lacks ablation experiments for two key loss terms (Lsc and Lr), both of which are described as important technical components.\n- The writing quality is poor, with numerous grammatical and structural errors throughout the paper.\n\nClarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility:\n\nClarity: The paper contains many unclear or incorrect sentences. A few examples:\n- “WSSS are often based on easily obtaining annotations, such as scribbles” → This sentence is grammatically incorrect.\n- “We argue that a shared shortcoming of previous ZS3 models falls in the reduced receptive field of CNNs and less uses attention mechanisms…” → The phrase “less uses” is incorrect.\n- “Current networkBaek et al. (2021) adopt traditional” → Missing space and grammatical issues.\n- “Although generative methods achieve impressive performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation tasks.The methods are limited by…” → Should replace the period with a comma or rephrase.\n- “The lsc is proposed by Baek et al. (2021), which define the relation…” → Grammatically incorrect; should read “which defines.”\n- Equation inconsistency: The overall loss is stated as L = Lce + Lr + λ1Lsc + λ2Laux, but the paper refers to Lps instead of Laux in Equation (2), causing confusion.\n\nQuality: The technical contribution is modest. The combination of standard loss terms with transformers provides incremental improvements but lacks deeper theoretical or architectural novelty.\n\nNovelty: The approach combines existing techniques—transformers and known loss functions—without introducing fundamentally new modeling principles. The method’s innovation lies primarily in integration rather than conceptual advancement.\n\nReproducibility: The overall structure of the model and training pipeline is understandable, but missing experimental details (e.g., ablations) limit reproducibility.\n\nSummary Of The Review:\nThe paper proposes a transformer-based model for zero-shot semantic segmentation combining multiple known loss functions. While it achieves decent empirical improvements, the contribution is limited in novelty and clarity. The writing contains numerous grammatical and structural issues, and key ablation studies are missing. The overall contribution is borderline and slightly below the acceptance threshold.\n\nCorrectness: 3: Some of the paper’s claims have minor issues. A few statements are not well-supported, or require small changes to be made correct.\nTechnical Novelty And Significance: 2: The contributions are only marginally significant or novel.\nEmpirical Novelty And Significance: 2: The contributions are only marginally significant or novel.\nFlag For Ethics Review: NO.\nRecommendation: 5: marginally below the acceptance threshold\nConfidence: 4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.",
    "text_summary": "### Structured Summary of the Paper\n\n#### Motivation\nZero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3) aims to classify both seen and unseen classes without requiring labeled data for unseen classes. Traditional methods, often based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), face challenges such as limited receptive fields, poor modeling of long-range dependencies, and bias toward seen classes. These limitations hinder their ability to effectively align visual features with semantic prototypes derived from word embeddings. Transformers, particularly Swin Transformers, have demonstrated superior performance in vision tasks due to their global attention mechanisms, making them well-suited for ZS3 tasks. This paper introduces **SwinZS3**, a novel framework that leverages Swin Transformers to address these challenges, providing a discriminative approach to ZS3 without the need for multi-stage training.\n\n#### Method\nThe SwinZS3 framework integrates a transformer-based image encoder with a language encoder to operate in a joint embedding space. Key components include:\n\n1. **Image Encoder**: A Swin Transformer extracts dense visual embeddings from input images, leveraging its multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism to capture global feature relationships.\n2. **Language Encoder**: Generates semantic prototypes using word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec), which represent class-level semantic information.\n3. **Pixel-Text Score Maps**: These maps align visual features with semantic prototypes in a hypersphere space. The alignment is supervised using ground-truth labels, enhancing the discriminative power of the joint embedding space.\n4. **Loss Functions**:\n   - **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Supervises classification on seen classes.\n   - **Pixel-Wise Regression Loss**: Aligns visual features with semantic prototypes for both seen and unseen classes.\n   - **Pixel-Text Score Map Loss**: Supervises the alignment of visual features and semantic prototypes in the hypersphere space.\n   - **Semantic Consistency Loss**: Transfers inter-class relationships from language embeddings to the semantic prototype space, ensuring semantic consistency.\n   The overall loss function is formulated as:\n   \\[\n   L = L_{ce} + L_{r} + \\lambda_1 L_{sc} + \\lambda_2 L_{aux}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) balance the contributions of different losses.\n5. **Improved Decision Boundary**: A modified nearest-neighbor classifier with weighted Euclidean distance (based on score maps) is used to reduce bias toward seen classes. The Apollonius circle method further adjusts decision boundaries to improve unseen class classification.\n\nDuring training, the model is trained only on seen classes, aligning visual features with semantic prototypes through the proposed loss functions. At inference, the model uses both seen and unseen class prototypes to classify visual features.\n\n#### Results\nThe effectiveness of SwinZS3 was evaluated on standard ZS3 benchmarks, including the PASCAL VOC 2012 and PASCAL Context datasets. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Performance**:\n   - SwinZS3 achieved state-of-the-art results on both datasets, significantly improving the segmentation accuracy of unseen classes.\n   - On the PASCAL Context 6-split, SwinZS3 achieved \\( mIoU_u = 39.3 \\) and \\( hIoU = 31.4 \\), outperforming existing methods by 3.1 and 3.1 points, respectively.\n2. **Ablation Studies**:\n   - Adding the pixel-text score map loss improved unseen class \\( mIoU \\) by 3.0–3.1 and harmonic mean \\( hIoU \\) by 1.9–2.1 over baselines.\n   - The transformer backbone provided a 1.0 \\( hIoU \\) gain over CNN-based methods like DeepLabv3+.\n   - Combining the transformer backbone with score maps yielded the best performance.\n3. **Comparison to State-of-the-Art**:\n   - SwinZS3 consistently outperformed methods like ZS3Net, CSRL, and JoEm across all dataset splits.\n   - Qualitative results demonstrated SwinZS3's ability to accurately segment unseen classes while reducing false positives.\n\n#### Conclusion\nSwinZS3 introduces a novel transformer-based framework for zero-shot semantic segmentation, addressing key limitations of existing methods. By leveraging the global reasoning capabilities of Swin Transformers and aligning visual and semantic embeddings through advanced loss functions, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ZS3 benchmarks. The one-stage training strategy and discriminative embedding space make SwinZS3 both efficient and effective. This work highlights the importance of global attention mechanisms, semantic supervision, and decision boundary adjustments in advancing ZS3 tasks, setting a new standard for future research in the field.",
