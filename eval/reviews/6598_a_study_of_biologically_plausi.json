    "title": "A Study of Biologically Plausible Neural Network: the Role and Interactions of Brain-Inspired Mechanisms in Continual Learning ",
    "abstract": "Humans excel at continually acquiring, consolidating, and retaining information from an ever-changing environment, whereas artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit catastrophic forgetting. There are considerable differences in the complexity of synapses, the processing of information, and the learning mechanisms in biological neural networks and their artificial counterpart, which may explain the mismatch in performance. We consider a biologically plausible framework that constitutes separate populations of exclusively excitatory and inhibitory neurons which adhere to Dale's principle and the excitatory pyramidal neurons are augmented with dendritic-like structures for context-dependent processing of stimuli. We then conduct a comprehensive study on the role and interactions of different mechanisms inspired by the brain including sparse non-overlapping representations, Hebbian learning, synaptic consolidation, and replay of past activations that accompanied the learning event. Our study suggests that employing multiple complementary mechanisms in a biologically plausible architecture, similar to the brain, can be effective in enabling continual learning in ANNs.",

    "text_summary": "### Motivation\nBiological neural networks excel at learning from dynamic environments due to their inherent properties, such as context-dependent processing, sparse activations, and specialized neuron roles. These features enable them to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, a challenge that artificial neural networks (ANNs) face in continual learning (CL). Unlike biological systems, standard ANNs lack mechanisms like Dale’s principle (separating excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and dendritic processing, which are critical for context-dependent learning. Recent studies have introduced biologically inspired mechanisms, such as Dale’s principle and dendritic segments, into ANNs, achieving comparable performance to standard models in static tasks. This study extends these approaches to the more challenging CL setting, aiming to bridge the gap between biological and artificial systems.\n\n### Method\nThe proposed framework, termed Bio-ANN, integrates multiple biologically inspired mechanisms to address catastrophic forgetting in CL. Key components include:\n\n1. **Dale’s Principle**: Neurons are divided into excitatory and inhibitory populations, with excitatory neurons projecting between layers and inhibitory neurons modulating activity within the same layer. This separation is mathematically modeled to ensure biologically plausible connectivity.\n2. **Dendritic Segments**: Excitatory neurons are augmented with dendritic-like structures that process contextual information. These segments modulate neuron outputs based on task-specific signals, enabling context-dependent processing.\n3. **Sparse Representations**: Activation sparsity is enforced using k-Winner-Take-All (k-WTA) activations and heterogeneous dropout. This reduces representational overlap, forming task-specific subnetworks and minimizing interference.\n4. **Hebbian Learning**: A \"fire together, wire together\" rule strengthens connections between context signals and dendritic segments, enhancing task-specific gating.\n5. **Synaptic Consolidation (SC)**: Synaptic Intelligence (SI) selectively reduces plasticity for critical synapses, with adjustments for excitatory and inhibitory neurons to minimize forgetting.\n6. **Experience Replay (ER)**: A memory buffer stores past activations, enabling context-specific replay to consolidate knowledge across tasks. Consistency regularization is applied to maintain structural similarities between tasks.\n\nThe framework was implemented in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers, 2048 units per layer, and a memory buffer of 500 samples. Sparse activations and dendritic segments were applied only to excitatory neurons, while inhibitory neurons modulated activity within layers.\n\n### Experiments\nThe framework was evaluated on three CL benchmarks:\n1. **Rot-MNIST**: Incrementally rotated digit classification tasks.\n2. **Perm-MNIST**: Tasks with permuted pixel arrangements.\n3. **Seq-MNIST**: Class-incremental learning with sequential digit classification.\n\nThe study analyzed the contributions of individual components (e.g., Hebbian learning, SC, ER, and heterogeneous dropout) and their combinations. Hyperparameters, such as learning rates for excitatory and inhibitory weights, were adjusted to balance forward transfer and interference.\n\n### Results\nThe Bio-ANN framework demonstrated significant improvements in CL performance across datasets. Key findings include:\n\n1. **Rot-MNIST**:\n   - Active dendrites alone achieved 92.72% accuracy for 5 tasks, 71.48% for 10 tasks, and 48.13% for 20 tasks.\n   - Adding Dale’s principle improved performance for 20 tasks (48.79%).\n   - Heterogeneous dropout further enhanced accuracy, reaching 51.11% for 20 tasks.\n\n2. **Perm-MNIST**:\n   - Active dendrites achieved 95.53% accuracy for 5 tasks, 94.37% for 10 tasks, and 91.76% for 20 tasks.\n   - Dale’s principle and Hebbian learning improved performance, with the full Bio-ANN model achieving 94.64% for 20 tasks.\n\n3. **Seq-MNIST**:\n   - Active dendrites alone achieved 20.06% accuracy.\n   - Adding ER, SC, and Hebbian learning incrementally improved performance, with the full Bio-ANN model reaching 79.28%.\n\n4. **Component Analysis**:\n   - Sparse activations reduced interference, particularly for dissimilar tasks, by minimizing representational overlap.\n   - Hebbian learning enhanced task-specific gating, improving context-dependent processing.\n   - Synaptic consolidation mitigated forgetting, especially for inhibitory weights, which have a higher impact on output distributions.\n   - Experience replay was critical for consolidating knowledge in class-incremental learning (Class-IL) scenarios.\n\n5. **Heterogeneous Dropout**:\n   - Layerwise dropout improved performance by balancing feature reuse in earlier layers and interference reduction in later layers. For example, in Rot-MNIST with 20 tasks, accuracy increased from 48.79% (no dropout) to 51.11% (with dropout).\n\n### Conclusion\nThis study demonstrates that integrating biologically inspired mechanisms, such as Dale’s principle, dendritic segments, sparse activations, Hebbian learning, synaptic consolidation, and experience replay, significantly enhances CL performance in ANNs. These mechanisms emulate brain-like processes, enabling context-dependent learning, reducing interference, and mitigating forgetting. The results highlight the potential of combining complementary components to achieve robust CL, providing insights into both artificial intelligence and neuroscience.\n\nFuture research could explore:\n- Designing biologically plausible context signals for dendritic processing.\n- Learning context signals end-to-end during training.\n- Extending the framework to more complex datasets and architectures.\n\nThe Bio-ANN framework represents a promising step toward bridging the gap between biological and artificial systems, advancing our understanding of both fields.",
