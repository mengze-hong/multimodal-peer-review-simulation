    "title": "Modeling content creator incentives on algorithm-curated platforms",
    "abstract": "Content creators compete for user attention. Their reach crucially depends on algorithmic choices made by developers on online platforms. To maximize exposure, many creators adapt strategically, as evidenced by examples like the sprawling search engine optimization industry. This begets competition for the finite user attention pool. We formalize these dynamics in what we call an exposure game, a model of incentives induced by modern algorithms including factorization and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly innocuous algorithmic choices—e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained factorization—significantly affect the existence and character of (Nash) equilibria in exposure games. We proffer use of creator behavior models like ours for an (ex-ante) pre-deployment audit. Such an audit can identify misalignment between desirable and incentivized content, and thus complement post-hoc measures like content filtering and moderation. To this end, we propose tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure games, and illustrate results of an audit on the MovieLens and LastFM datasets. Among else, we find that the strategically produced content exhibits strong dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity, and between model expressivity and bias towards gender-based user and creator groups.",
    "human_review": "Summary Of The Paper:\nThe paper studied the interaction effects between content producers and consumers. The dynamics in the interactions are well formalized as an exposure game about incentives. They provided a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the properties of Nash equilibria in the games and proposed tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure games. Both theory and empirical experiments verify the dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity, and between model expressivity and bias.\n\nStrength And Weaknesses:\nStrengths:\n\nThe paper is well-written and flows very smoothly. Despite the paper's modest space, it provides the required context and necessary explanation in a good job.\nMost parts of the paper have clear motivations. Many of my questions are well answered in the paper.\nFormulation and theoretical analysis of the exposure game in the recommender system is insightful. Most papers studied the recommender system in a fixed manner. I agree understanding the interaction effects/dynamics between the producer and customer is important and useful.\nThe analysis of diversity and exploration is interesting. The paper mentioned the game may concentrate on uniform distribution, and exploration may incentivize content that is uniform and broadly appealing rather than diverse. From the recent papers, I also found deeper models can achieve diversity/coverage and accuracy at the same time. These two concepts may not be contradictory. If could further reveal the relationship between these two, it'll be very interesting.\nThe paper identified several factors that can influence the recommendation seriously and provided a pre-deployment audit tool that can benefit the community.\nWeaknesses/Questions:\n\nIn eq. (2), the paper introduced the temperature parameter to control the spread of exposure probabilities. Many of the follow-up analyses and experiments are built on this. However, most recommender systems didn't include this in their objectives. Could you please explain the rationale or connectivity between these?\nOn page 3, I'm confused about the full control assumption. What's the difference between full control and partial control and why it can abstract away the explicit model of producer actions? Is it possible to list some concrete examples?\nFor experiments, how are the producers defined? In my opinion, there are only user/item information in these data sets.\nFor the L-NE solver in eq. (4), is this the paper originally proposed or adapted from others? I'm not familiar with the NE-based methods. It seems it's also updating the model with the gradient. Could you please illustrate a little more on the common points and difference between this one and the normal gradient descent method used to optimize ML model?\n\nClarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility:\nThe paper is mostly clear and well-written. The technical novelty is substantial as dynamics in the recommender system are well formalized and analyzed. The reproducibility is good, but the empirical evaluation and justification may not be comprehensive enough.\n\nSummary Of The Review:\nIn general, I think it's a good paper with clear novelty. Some of the descriptions and empirical experiments in the paper may require further explanations.\n\nCorrectness: 3: Some of the paper’s claims have minor issues. A few statements are not well-supported, or require small changes to be made correct.\nTechnical Novelty And Significance: 4: The contributions are significant, and do not exist in prior works.\nEmpirical Novelty And Significance: 2: The contributions are only marginally significant or novel.\nFlag For Ethics Review: NO.\nRecommendation: 8: accept, good paper\nConfidence: 3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.",
    "text_summary": "### Summary of the Paper\n\n#### Motivation\nThe paper, presented at ICLR 2023, investigates the socio-economic implications of algorithmic design in recommender systems, focusing on how these systems influence content creators' strategies to maximize exposure. The authors introduce the concept of \"exposure games,\" a formal model that captures the incentives created by algorithms, such as matrix factorization and deep two-tower architectures. The study aims to understand how algorithmic parameters, such as embedding constraints and exploration levels, shape content diversity, bias, and fairness. The work emphasizes the importance of pre-deployment audits to identify misalignments between incentivized and desirable content, particularly in scenarios where A/B testing is impractical.\n\n#### Methodology\nThe study models content creators as rational agents competing for exposure in a continuous embedding space, where algorithms rank content based on the inner product of user and item embeddings. Exposure probabilities are modeled using a softmax function, with the temperature parameter (\\(\\tau\\)) controlling the spread of exposure probabilities. High \\(\\tau\\) encourages exploration and broad appeal, while low \\(\\tau\\) promotes specialization. The authors analyze the existence and nature of Nash equilibria (NE) in these games, exploring both pure and mixed strategies, as well as approximate and local equilibria.\n\nThe paper also introduces \"non-negative exposure games,\" where embeddings are constrained to the positive orthant, reflecting real-world methods like TF-IDF and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Theoretical results are complemented by experiments using the MovieLens and LastFM datasets, employing probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) and NMF models to simulate producer behavior and evaluate the impact of algorithmic changes.\n\n#### Results\n1. **Theoretical Insights**:\n   - **Existence of Equilibria**: Mixed Nash Equilibria (MNE) always exist due to the continuity of utilities and compactness of the strategy space. However, Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) are not guaranteed, especially in softmax games (\\(\\tau > 0\\)) with non-convex strategy spaces.\n   - **Impact of \\(\\tau\\)**: High \\(\\tau\\) leads to uniform, broadly appealing content, while low \\(\\tau\\) results in niche targeting and local clustering. The trade-off between exploration and diversity is highlighted, with high \\(\\tau\\) potentially reducing diversity in competitive environments.\n   - **Non-Negative Games**: PNE are more likely to exist in non-negative hardmax games (\\(\\tau = 0\\)) for low-dimensional settings but may fail in higher dimensions or without non-negativity constraints.\n\n2. **Experimental Findings**:\n   - **Content Clustering**: Higher \\(\\tau\\) leads to greater content clustering around a central strategy, consistent with theoretical predictions. This behavior is observed across both MovieLens and LastFM datasets.\n   - **Gender Bias**: In MovieLens, higher embedding dimensions (\\(d = 50\\)) amplify gender bias, with content more frequently targeting male users. NMF models exacerbate this bias compared to PMF.\n   - **Producer Behavior**: The experiments reveal strong dependencies between algorithmic parameters (e.g., embedding dimension, exploration level) and the diversity and bias of incentivized content. For example, higher \\(\\tau\\) promotes uniform content, while lower \\(\\tau\\) encourages niche strategies.\n\n3. **Algorithmic Audits**:\n   - The authors propose a pre-deployment audit tool using exposure games to simulate producer behavior and evaluate the impact of algorithmic changes. This approach complements post-deployment measures like content filtering and moderation.\n\n4. **Computational Challenges**:\n   - Hardmax games (\\(\\tau = 0\\)) are computationally challenging due to non-differentiable utilities, making gradient-based methods inapplicable. The study employs local search algorithms and Riemannian second-order tests to identify Local Nash Equilibria (LNE).\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe paper underscores the importance of understanding the incentives created by recommender systems to mitigate negative societal consequences, such as reduced content diversity and amplified biases. The proposed pre-deployment audit tool offers a practical approach to assessing algorithmic impact on content producers, providing insights into the trade-offs between exploration, diversity, and fairness. While the study highlights the potential of exposure games as a behavior model, it acknowledges limitations, such as the assumptions of rationality and complete information, and calls for further research into the socio-economic effects of algorithmic design.\n\nThe findings have broader implications for the ethical design and regulation of algorithms, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in online platforms. By aligning algorithmic incentives with desirable outcomes, the study aims to foster responsible algorithmic behavior and minimize societal harms.",

The work highlights the trade-offs between exploration, diversity, and fairness, while emphasizing the importance of aligning algorithmic incentives with desirable societal outcomes.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Strengths\n1. **Timely and Relevant Problem**: The paper addresses a critical issue in the design of recommender systems—how algorithmic incentives shape producer behavior and societal outcomes. This topic is of significant importance given the increasing influence of algorithms on content creation and consumption.\n   \n2. **Novel Framework**: The introduction of \"exposure games\" as a formal model for analyzing producer behavior is innovative and provides a structured way to study the socio-economic effects of recommender systems.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Theoretical Analysis**:\n   - The paper rigorously analyzes the existence and nature of Nash equilibria in exposure games, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of producer strategies under different algorithmic configurations.\n   - The exploration of non-negative exposure games adds practical relevance, as these constraints reflect real-world algorithmic methods.\n\n4. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results on MovieLens and LastFM datasets effectively demonstrate the theoretical findings, such as the impact of exploration levels (\\(\\tau\\)) on content clustering and diversity.\n\n5. **Practical Contributions**: The proposed pre-deployment audit tool is a valuable contribution that can help practitioners evaluate the societal impact of recommender systems before deployment, addressing a key gap in current algorithmic auditing practices.\n\n6. **Ethical Implications**: The paper makes a strong case for the ethical design of recommender systems, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and accountability. This aligns with broader efforts to mitigate societal harms caused by algorithmic systems.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Weaknesses\n1. **Assumptions of Rationality and Complete Information**:\n   - The model assumes that content creators are fully rational agents with complete information about the system and other producers' strategies. This assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios, where creators often operate under uncertainty and with bounded rationality.\n   - A discussion on how these assumptions might affect the applicability of the findings would strengthen the paper.\n\n2. **Limited Exploration of User Behavior**:\n   - While the paper focuses on producer behavior, it largely abstracts away user behavior and preferences. In reality, user interactions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of recommender systems. Incorporating user behavior into the model could provide a more holistic understanding of the system.\n\n3. **Scalability and Computational Challenges**:\n   - The computational challenges of hardmax games (\\(\\tau = 0\\)) are acknowledged, but the proposed solutions (e.g., local search algorithms) may not scale well to large, real-world datasets. A more detailed discussion of scalability and potential optimizations would be beneficial.\n\n4. **Bias Analysis**:\n   - While the paper identifies gender bias in the MovieLens dataset, the analysis of bias is relatively narrow. Expanding the scope to include other forms of bias (e.g., racial, cultural) and their interactions with algorithmic parameters would enhance the study's significance.\n\n5. **Experimental Limitations**:\n   - The experiments are limited to two datasets (MovieLens and LastFM), which may not fully capture the diversity of real-world recommender systems. Extending the evaluation to additional datasets and domains would improve the generalizability of the findings.\n   - The choice of models (PMF and NMF) is somewhat restrictive, as modern recommender systems often employ more sophisticated architectures (e.g., deep learning-based methods). Evaluating the framework with state-of-the-art models would increase its practical relevance.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Clarity & Reproducibility\n- **Clarity**: The paper is well-written and clearly structured, with a logical flow from problem formulation to theoretical analysis, experiments, and conclusions. The mathematical formulations are precise, and the theoretical results are presented in a comprehensible manner.\n- **Reproducibility**: \n   - The paper provides sufficient details about the experimental setup, including datasets, models, and evaluation metrics. However, the availability of code and data is not explicitly mentioned. Open-sourcing the implementation would significantly enhance reproducibility.\n   - The computational methods for identifying Nash equilibria (e.g., local search algorithms) are described at a high level, but additional implementation details would be helpful for replication.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Novelty & Significance\n- **Novelty**:\n   - The concept of \"exposure games\" is a novel and valuable contribution to the field of algorithmic fairness and socio-economic analysis of recommender systems.\n   - The theoretical insights into the existence and nature of Nash equilibria in these games are original and provide a solid foundation for future research.\n\n- **Significance**:\n   - The study addresses an important and underexplored aspect of recommender systems—the incentives they create for content producers. By highlighting the societal implications of algorithmic design, the paper contributes to the broader discourse on responsible AI.\n   - The proposed pre-deployment audit tool has practical significance, offering a proactive approach to evaluating and mitigating the negative impacts of recommender systems.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Recommendation\nThe paper makes a strong contribution to the field of recommender systems by introducing a novel framework for analyzing producer behavior and its societal implications. While there are some limitations, particularly regarding assumptions, scalability, and experimental scope, the strengths of the work outweigh these weaknesses. I recommend acceptance, with minor revisions to address the identified issues and improve the paper's clarity, reproducibility, and generalizability.",
