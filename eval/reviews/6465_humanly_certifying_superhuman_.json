    "title": "Humanly Certifying Superhuman Classifiers",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses a key question in current machine learning research: if we believe that a model's predictions might be better than those given by human experts, how can we (humans) verify these beliefs? In some cases, this ``superhuman'' performance is readily demonstrated; for example by defeating top-tier human players in traditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to evaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance. Indeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly assumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human annotations. In reality, human annotators are subjective and can make mistakes. Evaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle is more objective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is more expensive or sometimes impossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the performance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is . We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the oracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis provides an executable recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in this setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of current research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds and the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with known oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by meta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an oracle does not exist, and show that under our mild assumptions a number of models from recent years have already achieved superhuman performance with high probability---suggesting that our new oracle based performance evaluation metrics are overdue as an alternative to the widely used accuracy metrics that are naively based on imperfect human annotations.",
    "human_review": "Summary Of The Paper:\nThis paper proposes an approach to certify whether a given machine learning model achieves super-human performance when the dataset labels are (possibly erroneous) human annotations and not (unobserved) ground-truth labels. The proposed approached relies on proving the following results (given human annotators and infinite data):\n\n(Theorem 1) The probability that a randomly selected human annotator labels all samples correctly is bounded above by the root mean squared inter-annotator agreement.\n\n(Theorem 3) The probability that the machine learning model predicts the labels of all samples correctly is bounded below by the probability that the machine learning model predicts labels that match the aggregated human-annotated labels (aggregated via majority voting, for example).\n\nNote that the lower bound in Theorem 3 is basically the machine learning model accuracy with respect to the human annotations, as is traditionally reported. The paper also proves variants of the theorems above for finite data samples.\n\nThe theorems above rely on the following assumptions:\n\nHuman annotators are not independent; their annotations are \"positively correlated\".\nEven if the aggregated human annotation is incorrect, the machine learning model is more likely to predict the correct label than the incorrect human annotation.\nThe proposed approach essentially compares the upper bound for human annotators (Theorem 1) with the lower bound for the machine learning model (Theorem 3). The paper also provides a way to construct confidence intervals on the difference between these two bounds. The paper concludes with an empirical evaluation of the proposed theory.\n\nStrength And Weaknesses:\nThis paper has several strengths.\n\nIt considers an important problem: how can we theoretically guarantee that a given model exceeds human annotation performance? More importantly, it enables qualifying claims of superhuman performance by quantifying whether the observed/reported superhuman performance is statistically significant for a given number of annotators with a specific inter-annotator agreement.\n\nThe paper approaches this problem in a principled manner, by deriving upper bounds on human performance and lower bounds on model performance (without needing access to ground truth labels). The paper also derives finite sample variants of these bounds that are practically useful, and derives confidence intervals on the difference between these two bounds. All assumptions are clearly stated.\n\nThe paper concludes with an empirical evaluation of the proposed theory, which covers several important aspects of the theory such as the validity of the assumptions, whether the bounds are valid empirically, and how they vary as the number of annotators increases.\n\nClarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility:\nI have a few concerns about the clarity and quality of this paper, enumerated below.\n\n1. Unclear random vs. deterministic quantities in the problem statement\n\nI think the distinction between what is random and what is deterministic in the problem statement could be clearer.\n\nSince the dataset of points is fixed and not a random sample, the ratio of matched labels and each agreement score is deterministic. The expectation over annotators, in contrast, is random. The usage of the same symbol for both random and deterministic quantities makes following the problem statement a bit difficult.\n\nLater in Theorem 1, the agreement is treated like a probabilistic quantity, which suggests that it is the probability that two annotators agree on all labels for a randomly sampled dataset of points. However, this contradicts the earlier deterministic definition. It would help if the notation made the appropriate interpretation of each probability unambiguous.\n\n2. Unclear meaning of “agreement is overestimated as 1”\n\nBased on Section 2.1, agreement is given for fixed annotators, hence it is a deterministic fraction. What does it mean to “estimate” or “overestimate” it?\n\n3. Clarity and restrictiveness of the assumption in Lemma 2\n\nLemma 2 assumes that the inter-annotator agreement is high. Should this hold for every pair of annotators? One interpretation is that it represents the probability that two annotators agree on all labels, which is likely small in practice, while another interpretation treats it as the fraction of labels where annotators agree, which is typically high. Clarifying this distinction would help.\n\n4. How are the bounds in Figure 3 calculated for the case of just one annotator?\n\nThe formula for the lower bound does not make this clear.\n\n5. Possible conflict between the assumptions of Theorem 1 and 3\n\nTheorem 1 assumes that human annotators are positively correlated. Theorem 3 assumes that even when aggregated human annotations are incorrect, the model can predict correctly. Given that models are trained on human annotations, these assumptions may appear in tension. Considering extreme cases (e.g., highly correlated or inaccurate annotators) may help clarify their applicability.\n\n6. Minor Grammatical/Spelling Errors:\n\n“Within this setting provide...” “along some labels” “for all of a pairs” “affects their decisions, and etc.” “we introduce another assumption equation” “in that as even”\n\nSummary Of The Review:\nThis paper considers the important problem of certifying whether an ML model achieves superhuman performance, and provides a principled approach to doing so. The proposed approach is clear and transparent in its assumptions. However, some of the notation makes it difficult to follow the paper, and the restrictiveness of the assumptions in practice is insufficiently explored. While both these drawbacks are significant, I believe they are addressable.\n\nCorrectness: 4: All of the claims and statements are well-supported and correct.\nTechnical Novelty And Significance: 4: The contributions are significant, and do not exist in prior works.\nEmpirical Novelty And Significance: Not applicable\nFlag For Ethics Review: NO.\nRecommendation: 8: accept, good paper\nConfidence: 3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.",
    "text_summary": "### Motivation\nThe paper, presented at ICLR 2023, addresses the challenge of verifying \"superhuman\" performance in machine learning models, particularly in classification tasks. While superhuman performance is straightforward to demonstrate in games with objective metrics (e.g., Go or Dota2), evaluating classification models is more complex due to the reliance on human annotations as ground truth. Human annotations are subjective and prone to errors, making them an unreliable benchmark for assessing model performance. The authors argue for a more robust evaluation framework that compares models to an unobserved oracle, representing the true ground truth. This approach is necessary as machine learning models increasingly surpass human performance, exposing the limitations of current evaluation methods that rely on aggregated human annotations or inter-annotator agreement.\n\n### Methodology\nThe paper introduces a theoretical framework to estimate the oracle accuracy of machine learning models and human annotators using only imperfect human annotations. The framework provides:\n1. **Upper bounds** for the average oracle accuracy of human annotators, derived from inter-annotator agreement.\n2. **Lower bounds** for the oracle accuracy of machine learning models, calculated using aggregated human annotations.\n3. A **finite sample analysis** for both bounds, quantifying the margin by which a model outperforms human annotators.\n4. A **confidence score** to certify superhuman performance, using metrics like Human Margin Score (HMS) and Oracle Margin Score (OMS).\n\nThe framework introduces algorithms to detect and certify superhuman models:\n- **Heuristic Margin Separation (HMS):** Assigns a fixed margin to compute confidence scores.\n- **Optimal Margin Separation (OMS):** Optimizes confidence scores using gradient ascent.\n\nThe theoretical framework is validated through synthetic experiments with known oracles and applied to real-world natural language processing (NLP) tasks where no oracle exists.\n\n### Experiments\n#### Synthetic Tasks\nTwo synthetic classification tasks were designed to validate the framework:\n1. **Color Classification:** Identify the most frequent color in an image containing 40 objects of three colors.\n2. **Shape Classification:** Identify the most frequent shape in an image containing 37 objects of five shapes.\n\nOracle labels were determined by explicit rules, and human annotations were collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results demonstrated:\n- The convergence of empirical upper bounds to theoretical upper bounds as the number of annotators increased.\n- Validation of theoretical assumptions, such as the positive correlation between annotators and the oracle.\n\n#### Real-World Tasks\nThe framework was applied to large-scale NLP datasets:\n1. **Sentiment Classification (SST-2 and SST-5):** Models were evaluated on binary and five-class sentiment classification tasks using the Stanford Sentiment Treebank.\n2. **Natural Language Inference (SNLI):** Models were tested on a three-class task (Contradiction, Entailment, Neutral) using the SNLI corpus.\n\nState-of-the-art models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and SemBERT, were evaluated. Results showed that several models achieved superhuman performance with high confidence:\n- For SST-2, StructBERT achieved 0.971 accuracy, exceeding the theoretical upper bound for human annotators.\n- For SNLI, SemBERT achieved 0.919 accuracy, surpassing human performance with near-perfect confidence scores.\n\n### Results\nThe study addressed three key research questions:\n1. **Do bounds converge with more annotators?**\n   - Empirical upper bounds tightened with more annotators, providing reliable estimates of human oracle accuracy.\n2. **Are theoretical assumptions valid?**\n   - Assumptions about annotator correlation and model performance relative to the oracle were validated in both synthetic and real-world tasks.\n3. **Can superhuman models be identified?**\n   - Several models were certified as superhuman, with confidence scores quantifying their outperformance over human annotators.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe paper provides a robust theoretical and empirical framework for evaluating machine learning models relative to human annotators. It introduces practical methods for estimating performance bounds and certifying superhuman models, validated through synthetic and real-world experiments. The findings highlight the limitations of human annotations as ground truth and emphasize the need for oracle-based evaluation metrics. The framework has significant implications for human-computer collaboration, particularly in critical applications like healthcare and law, where trusting model predictions over human judgments may be necessary.\n\n### Broader Impact and Limitations\nThe framework offers a principled approach to evaluating machine learning models, guiding decisions on when to prefer machine predictions over human ones. However, it requires multiple annotators and assumes a single correct answer per task, limiting its applicability to multi-label or subjective tasks. The authors recommend validating assumptions with a small set of oracle annotations when possible. The study underscores the importance of high-quality human annotations and their variability across tasks, advocating for more rigorous evaluation methods as machine learning models continue to advance.",

The use of synthetic and real-world tasks to validate the framework is well-documented.\n- **Reproducibility**: While the theoretical framework and algorithms are described in detail, the paper does not provide sufficient information on the implementation specifics, such as hyperparameters, code, or datasets used. Sharing code and data would significantly enhance reproducibility.\n- **Figures and Results**: The figures and tables are clear and effectively illustrate the key findings. However, additional visualizations, such as the impact of annotator quality on bounds or confidence scores, could provide deeper insights.\n\n#### 5. Novelty & Significance\n- **Novelty**: The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for evaluating machine learning models relative to an unobserved oracle, addressing a critical gap in the field. The use of bounds and confidence scores to certify superhuman performance is innovative and well-motivated.\n- **Significance**: The findings have significant implications for the evaluation and deployment of machine learning models, particularly in high-stakes applications where trusting model predictions over human judgments is necessary. The framework challenges the reliance on human annotations as ground truth and advocates for more robust evaluation metrics.\n- **Impact**: The study's emphasis on oracle-based evaluation metrics is likely to influence future research and practices in machine learning evaluation, particularly as models continue to surpass human performance in various domains.\n\n#### Overall Assessment\nThis paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning evaluation by addressing the limitations of human annotations as ground truth and proposing a robust framework for certifying superhuman performance. While there are some limitations, such as the assumptions on oracle existence and the focus on NLP tasks, the paper's strengths in theoretical rigor, practical utility, and broader implications outweigh these weaknesses. With additional efforts to enhance reproducibility and explore the framework's applicability to other domains, this work has the potential to become a foundational reference in the evaluation of machine learning models.",
