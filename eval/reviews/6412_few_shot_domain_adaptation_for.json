    "abstract": "The problem of end-to-end learning of a communication system using an autoencoder -- consisting of an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled using neural networks -- has recently been shown to be an effective approach. A challenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that under changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent retraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate. Since retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples, it becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We propose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot) domain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks. Different from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised domain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source distribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution using only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a generative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN), and propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a set of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used to design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the distribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the source distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common to the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples.",
    "human_review": "Summary Of The Paper:\nThe paper addresses the problem of handling domain-shifts that arises in generative learnt channel models in E2E communication systems in a few-shot setting.\nThe proposed domain adaptation approach is tailored around a Mixture Density Network (MDN) representing the channel model. In here, the approach:\nlearns an adapter layer, which models an affine transform of the original conditional channel distribution\nintroduces an additional regularization objective to ensure the adapter doesn't converge to bad/degenerate solutions\npresents a feature transformation formulation on the decoder side to aid learning on the domain-shifted distributions\nThe approach is evaluated extensively, covering multiple types of distribution changes in both synthethic settings as well on a high-resolution mmWave testbed.\n\nStrength And Weaknesses:\nStrengths\n1. Extensive evaluation\n\nThe approach is evaluated rigorously with well-suited baselines and a range of scenarios (e.g., multiple types of domain shifts, real-world evaluation). I especially appreciate evaluations studying when the (reasonable) assumptions are violated.\n2. Motivation and relevant problem\n\nWhile there has been a lot of attention on generative channel modelling recently, most works in my knowledge largely (and somewhat incorrectly) assume a stationary distribution. This paper takes a step in the right direction by addressing this pain-point.\n3. Insightful approach\n\nThe approach overall is insightful and makes sense. By learning an adapter network and learning parameters relevant for the domain shifts (e.g., like FiLM modules), it makes few-shot domain-adaptation more tractable.\nFurthermore, I find the choice of the channel model representation (MDNs) to also be sufficiently appropriate for the task (as opposed to GANs) for this study.\n\nConcerns\n1. \"labeled set obtained for free\"\n\nThe paper at multiple times claims that few-shot learning is especially possible since we can get labeled dataset for free -- I find this slightly confusing.\nWouldn't the labeled dataset be split between the encoder (transmitter) and decoder (receiver) devices? As a result, for a party to have the full labeled dataset, isn't a prerequisite communicating labels back to the other party?\n2. Evaluation: Some observations unclear\n\nI found some patterns in the evaluation was somewhat unclear and would appreciate the authors' answers on the questions below:\n(a) Oracle-approach gap in Figure 4/5: I'm slightly surprised that proposed approach's symbol error rate does not converge to the oracle with a reasonable number of additional examples (50 * 16-QAM classes = 800), given that there are 50 learnable parameters. Are the authors aware if convergence is possible with even higher examples? Morevover, what is the size of the source dataset?\n(b) Unchanged error rates in Figure 4/5 for many baselines: Are the authors aware of why the error rates of many baselines do not improve at all in spite of more training examples? Were the \"finetune\" baselines finedtuned only on the new data or a combination? In the case of combination, are domain-invariant features learnt?\n(nitpick) Please summarize the performance degradation discussions in Ricean fading experiments in the main paper.\n3. Evaluation: Performance under no distribution change\n\nI appreciate that the authors also evaluate under a non-domain shifted dataset in Figure 10. Can the authors clarify why results drop in performance when there is no distribution change?\nSpecifically, it appears that the adapter layers' parameters are initialized such that it produces a identity mapping (page 18), so I'm surprised that this nonetheless degrades performance.\n4. SNR=14-20 dB\n\nCan the authors comment whether a SNR of 14-20dB (which to me appears really large) is a reasonable setting? Did the authors also evaluate SNR vs. error rates for the approach and baselines? I wonder if the results shown here apply only in high SNR regimes.\n\nClarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility:\nClarity: Good. It was generally easy reading the paper, thanks to really crisp text and a comprehensive background section. The minor issue I found is that some patterns in the results are not discussed (see concern 2, 3) The only nitpick I have are the figures (esp. Figures 4-6) where legends are highly illegible.\n\nQuality: Good. While there are minor discrepancies the approach (e.g., performance slightly deteriorates when there is no distribution change, does not translate well to certain distribution changes), I think it can be overlooked in light of the remaining contributions.\n\nNovelty: Very good. The authors tackle a very well motivated problem (see strength 2) and propose an insightful approach to tackle it (see strength 3).\n\nReproducibility: Very good. The main paper (esp. the large appendix) appears to contain many details of the approach. Additionally, the code is provided as well. I'm not sure if the authors plan to release the channels from the mmWave FPGA testbed.\n\nSummary Of The Review:\nThe paper tackles a relevant bottleneck in generative channel modelling for E2E communication systems (i.e., they are trained assuming a stationary distribution, but this isn't the typical case). The approach is novel and intuitive in my opinion, and is further evaluated extensively in both simulated and real conditions. While I have some minor concerns (e.g., can one really have a labelled dataset for this task in practise?), I don't think they significantly affect the paper's claims and contributions.\n\nCorrectness: 3: Some of the paper’s claims have minor issues. A few statements are not well-supported, or require small changes to be made correct.\nTechnical Novelty And Significance: 4: The contributions are significant, and do not exist in prior works.\nEmpirical Novelty And Significance: 4: The contributions are significant, and do not exist in prior works.\nFlag For Ethics Review: NO.\nRecommendation: 8: accept, good paper\nConfidence: 3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.",
    "text_summary": "### Motivation\nThe paper addresses the challenge of adapting end-to-end (e2e) communication systems, modeled using autoencoders, to dynamic channel conditions. Autoencoders, comprising an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled with neural networks, optimize communication systems by minimizing the symbol error rate (SER). However, frequent retraining under changing channel conditions is impractical due to high computational and data requirements. The study focuses on test-time few-shot domain adaptation (DA), where only a small labeled dataset from the target domain is available, avoiding the need for retraining the encoder and decoder networks.\n\n### Method\nThe proposed method introduces a lightweight, sample-efficient adaptation technique for a Mixture Density Network (MDN)-based generative channel model. The MDN models the channel as a Gaussian mixture, predicting parameters (means, covariances, and prior probabilities) as functions of the input symbol. The adaptation involves:\n1. **Affine Transformations for MDN Parameters**: Gaussian mixture parameters are adjusted using affine transformations:\n   - Means: \\( \\hat{\\mu}_i(z) = A_i\\mu_i(z) + b_i \\)\n   - Covariances: \\( \\hat{\\Sigma}_i(z) = C_i\\Sigma_i(z)C_i^T \\)\n   - Prior logits: \\( \\hat{\\alpha}_i(z) = \\beta_i\\alpha_i(z) + \\gamma_i \\)\n   These transformations align the target domain inputs with the source distribution while keeping the encoder and decoder networks unchanged.\n2. **Regularized Adaptation Objective**: The adaptation minimizes the negative symbol posterior log-likelihood (PLL) and a KL-divergence term between source and target Gaussian mixtures:\n   \\[\n   J_{PLL}(\\psi; \\lambda) = -\\frac{1}{N_t} \\sum_{n=1}^{N_t} \\log P_{\\hat{\\theta}_c}(z_t^n | x_t^n) + \\lambda D_\\psi(P_{\\theta_c}, P_{\\hat{\\theta}_c}),\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\lambda \\) is a regularization hyperparameter.\n3. **Feature Transformation for the Decoder**: A computationally efficient transformation maps target Gaussian distributions to source distributions, ensuring robust decoding.\n\nThe adaptation is computationally efficient, requiring optimization of only a small number of parameters (\\( |\\psi| \\)), and avoids retraining the encoder or decoder.\n\n### Results\n#### Simulated Experiments\n1. **Channel Variations**: The method was tested on simulated channel models, including Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), Ricean fading, and Uniform fading. It demonstrated significant SER reductions across most scenarios, except for AWGN to Ricean fading, where performance was suboptimal due to the high separability of the target distribution.\n2. **Random Gaussian Mixtures**: The method adapted effectively even when the source and target Gaussian mixtures had mismatched components, highlighting its robustness.\n\n#### Real-World FPGA Experiments\n1. **Setup**: Experiments were conducted on a 60 GHz mmWave FPGA testbed with IQ imbalance-based distortions.\n2. **Performance**: The method achieved a 69% SER reduction compared to baselines using only 10 labeled samples per class, demonstrating its practical applicability.\n\n#### Ablation Studies\n1. **KL-Divergence Regularization**: The KL-divergence term was critical for performance, preventing overfitting in small-sample settings.\n2. **Validation Metric for \\( \\lambda \\)**: An automatic selection of \\( \\lambda \\) using a validation metric outperformed fixed values, ensuring robust adaptation.\n\n#### Comparison with Baselines\nThe method outperformed traditional DA approaches, such as adversarial learning (e.g., DANN) and fine-tuning, which were computationally expensive and ineffective for small target datasets. It also showed competitive performance compared to retrained autoencoders, which require large target datasets.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe study presents a practical, parameter-efficient solution for adapting e2e communication systems to dynamic environments. By leveraging lightweight transformations and regularized adaptation, the method achieves strong performance with minimal data and computational overhead. It is validated on both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating robustness under various distribution shifts. Future work could explore joint adaptation of the encoder, decoder, and channel networks to further improve performance.
